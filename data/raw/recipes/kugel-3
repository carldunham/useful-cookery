.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE KUGEL-3 M "16 Mar 87" 1987
.RZ "POTATO-CARROT KUGEL" "Kugel with potatoes and carrots"
I have adapted this recipe from a recipe for ``Blender potato kugel'' by
Marilyn Michelson in the \fITemple Emanuel Sisterhood Cook Book\fR, compiled
1968 (no copyright notice), Baltimore, Maryland.  The carrot part is my idea
(it gives the kugel a golden color and also a better flavor, I think).
This dish smells wonderful, tastes great, and is definitely filling.
.PP
With suitable modifications (see notes) this dish can be made kosher for
Passover.
.IH "Serves 4\-6"
.IG "6" "large potatoes,"
peeled (about
.AB "4 lb" "2 kg" )
.IG "4" "carrots,"
peeled

Pour into pan, sprinkle top with paprika, and bake for 1 hour

.NX
For a pareve version, substitute for the chicken fat
.AB "4 Tbsp" "60 ml"
vegetable
oil, and for flavor optionally substitute for the salt and sugar

potato starch in place of the flour.
