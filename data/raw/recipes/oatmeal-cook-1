.RZ "INVISIBLE OATMEAL COOKIES" "Delicious high-fiber oatmeal drop cookies."
These oatmeal cookies are for cookie lovers to splurge with.  Not only
are they great tasting, but they are very high in fiber content and easy
to make.  The recipe is mine and is based on several different ideas in
different cookbooks as how to best to make them.  In fun, I call them
``Invisible Oatmeal Cookies'' because they are wont to disappear whenever
unguarded.  Enjoy.
