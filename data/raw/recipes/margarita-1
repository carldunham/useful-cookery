.SK 1
Blend equal parts of limeade, vodka, and water in a blender.
.SK 2
Add ice, and blend to slushiness desired.  More ice makes it slushier.

Officially, a margarita calls for tequila instead of the vodka, with a
splash of triple sec. No one notices the absence of the triple sec 
and many people prefer the taste of vodka.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
trivial.
.I Time:
2 minutes.
.I Precision:
use equal measures of the ingredients.
