.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BANANA-BREAD D "6 Oct 86" 1987
.RZ "AYALLA'S BANANA BREAD" "Banana-nut bread"
This recipe is from my friend Ayalla.
It makes a heavy, but moist, loaf of banana bread.
.IH "1 loaf"
.IG "3" "very ripe bananas"
.IG "1 cup" "sugar" "190 g"
.IG "\(12 cup" "shortening (butter)" "125 g"
.IG "2" "eggs"
.IG "3 Tbsp" "yoghurt or sour cream" "50 ml"
.IG "2 cups" "flour" "200 g"
.IG "1 tsp" "baking soda" "5 ml"
.IG "1 cup" "chopped walnuts" "115 g"
.IG "" "rum, vanilla, or amaretto"
(optional)
.PH          
.SK 1
Preheat the oven to
.TE 350 175 .
Cream the shortening and sugar.
.SK 2
Mix in the bananas.
.SK 3
Mix in the remaining ingredients.
.SK 4
Pour into a greased loaf pan.
.SK 5
Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at
.TE 350 175 .
.NX            
If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you
lower the oven temperature and cook for a while longer.
Otherwise, the crust comes out almost overcooked while the
middle remains moist and almost undercooked.
.SH RATING

.I Time:
Preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes.
