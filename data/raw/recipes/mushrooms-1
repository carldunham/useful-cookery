In a large frypan, melt the butter.
Saut\z\(aae mushrooms in butter until tender (about 5 minutes).

Mix flour and chicken base together.
Sprinkle over mushrooms.
Cook one more minute, stirring.

Add sour cream, lemon juice, and all seasonings.
Cook 2 to 3 minutes more, stirring.
.NX
We use chicken broth or chicken bouillon. If you use a vegetable broth this
is a vegetarian dish.
.PP
If you can resist digging in right away, cook this ahead of
time to give the flavors a chance to mellow.
At serving time, rewarm carefully over low heat.
This is wonderful as a main dish served over rice, noodles
or fettucini Alfredo.
