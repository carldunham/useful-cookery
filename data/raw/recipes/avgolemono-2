.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE AVGOLEMONO-2 SP "18 Nov 86" 1987
.RZ "QUICK AVGOLEMONO SOUP" "Greek egg-lemon soup"
This is a perfect way to use up a little leftover rice.
.IH "4 servings"

.SK 1
If you don't have any leftover white rice, put
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 g"
of rice on to cook.
.SK 2
Heat the chicken broth to boiling.
.SK 3
While the chicken broth is heating, beat together the lemon juice and eggs
in a small bowl or glass measuring cup until uniform in color.
.SK 4
When the chicken broth is boiling, stir in the cooked rice.  Remove from
heat and stir briskly while slowly pouring the egg mixture into the pot from
about a foot in the air.  The soup should end up resembling a cream soup and
there should be no large visible threads of egg.
.NX
This recipe even works well with canned chicken broth since the lemon
covers up the ``canned'' flavor.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
Easy
.I Time:
20 minutes if you have to cook the rice, 10 minutes if you don't.
.I Precision:
No need to measure.
