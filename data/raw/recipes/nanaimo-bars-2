.RZ "NAINAIMO BARS II" "No-bake 3-layer (chocolate covered) bars"
Nanaimo bars are a traditional Canadian dessert, though nobody is certain
where the tradition came from. Laura Secord is a Canadian candy company;
their cook book says this about the origin of these fattening delicacies:
.br
``A version of these no-bake bars developed in the Canadian kitchens of
a well-known food company, was christened by them "Nanaimo bars" after
the city of that name on Vancouver Island.  Nanaimo (from sne-ny-mo, a 
local Indian term for a loose confederation of five bands) started as 
a Hudson Bay Trading Post in 1849.''
