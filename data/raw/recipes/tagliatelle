.SK 1
Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil,
add some salt and a few drops of oil and cook the tagliatelle
for 8 minutes.
.SK 2
Meanwhile, melt
.AB "1 oz" "25 g"
of butter in a small pan and cook the chopped bacon
for 3\-4 minutes.
.SK 3
Beat the egg yolks together with the remainder of the butter,
the parmesan cheese, the cream, and some freshly-milled black pepper.
.SK 4
Drain the tagliatelle and put it back in the pan quickly
so as not to lose heat.
.SK 5
Add the bacon and its juices to the pasta,
pour in the egg and cream mixture, and toss well.
(If you've done this quickly enough,
the heat from the pasta will cook the egg yolks to a creamy sauce).
.SK 6
Season with salt and pepper if desired,
then serve with more parmesan.
.NX
Serve accompanied with green vegetables such as courgettes (zucchini)
or leeks, or with a green salad.
.PP
For aesthetic reasons, green tagliatelle looks best when served.
.PP
``Double cream'' is a product not normally available in North America. It
has 40% butterfat; ``whipping cream'' has 30% butterfat. If you make this
recipe with whipping cream instead of double cream, then use
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 g" 
more butter.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate (timing is critical).
.I Time:
15 minutes.
.I Precision:
measure carefully.
