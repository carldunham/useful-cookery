.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE FUDGE-1 D "22 Nov 85" 1986
.RZ "CHOCOLATE FUDGE" "Rich fattening chocolate fudge"
This recipe makes fudge. Not fudge brownies, just fudge.
I'm not sure what else to say about it.
.IH "Makes 1 8-inch pan" "Makes 1 20-cm pan"
.IG "2 cups" "sugar" "400 g"
(granulated)
.IG "1 cup" "condensed milk" "225 ml"
(unsweetened!)
.IG "2 \(12 Tbsp" "butter" "40 g"
.IG "\(14 tsp" "salt" "1 g"
.IG "2 oz" "unsweetened chocolate" "50 g"
(I use Hershey's baking chocolate. Bakers chocolate does NOT work)
.IG "1 Tbsp" "corn syrup" "15 ml"
(light)
.IG "1 cup" "walnuts" "300 g"
(chopped)
.IG "1 tsp" "vanilla extract" "5 ml"
.IG "1 Tbsp" "rum" "15 ml"
(I use Stroh's Inlander rum)
.PH
.SK 1
Combine sugar, condensed milk, butter, salt, chocolate, and corn syrup
in a HEAVY
.AB "3-quart" "3-liter"
saucepan. Heat slowly.
.SK 2
Stir until everything is melted.  When the chocolate is melted
thoroughly, beat with electric mixer (I ain't proud!) until smooth.
.SK 3
Let cook to halfway between soft and medium ball stage (use candy
thermometer if available)
.SK 4
Let cool until barely touchable. (due to heat)
.SK 5
Stir in chopped walnuts, vanilla, and rum.
Beat the mixture until it starts to set.
.SK 6
When it \fIstarts\fR to set, get it into 
.AB "an 8-inch" "a 20-cm"
square pan.
(buttered, of course)  If you wait to do this, you will eat it out of the
saucepan.
.NX
This is guaranteed to cause obesity if over-indulged in.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
Moderate to hard. Melted chocolate is tricky, and the timing is fairly
important.
.I Time:
about an hour.
.I Precision:
Measurement important for some ingredients.
