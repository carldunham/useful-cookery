.RZ "ROSALIE'S CHEESE AND SPINACH PIE" "A rich spinach pie with ham and cheese"
I ate this dish at Cafe Le Rat in Middleburg, Virginia, and was delighted to
find their recipe in \fIGourmet\fR magazine in the late 1970's.
I have modified the recipe somewhat from the published version to make it
less stringy and sticky.
