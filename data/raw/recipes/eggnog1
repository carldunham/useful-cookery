Beat yolks until light. Add sugar and mix well. Add milk and rum.
Mix well, then chill for at least 3 hours.

One hour before serving, whip cream and stir into chilled
mixture. Return to refrigerator for an hour.

This stuff is POTENT, even if you reduce the rum by half.
Brandy, dark rum or bourbon may be substituted for the light rum. If
you prefer a nonalcoholic eggnog, leave out the booze
altogether. With or without booze, this eggnog is very rich, and very
good.
