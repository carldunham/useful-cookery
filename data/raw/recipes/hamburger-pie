Add the worchestershire sauce, salt, pepper and flour.
Simmer until the juice thickens.

Separate the biscuits and brush the edges with the egg.
Put the biscuits against the sides and bottom of a pie plate so it is
completely covered.
.SK 4
Stir the rest of the egg into the meat mixture and then spoon the meat
into the pie shell.
If you wish you can garnish with a few tomato wedges.
.SK 5
Bake in a pre-heated oven at
.TE 450 235
for about 8 to 10 minutes.
The biscuits should be slightly browned.
.NX
This gets its name because the biscuits around the edge puff up to
look like the petals around the center of a sunflower.
This is a great bachelor meal because you can come in from work and
make it without much effort, time or dish washing.
You can play with different spices to change the flavor.
Some of my friends like to put cheese on top before baking it.
.PP
If you live outside North America, remember that a biscuit is a scone.
