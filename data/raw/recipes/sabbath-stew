.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE SABBATH-STEW M "20 May 86" 1986
.RZ "SHABBOS-CHOULNT" "European Jewish traditional sabbath stew"
This is a food that religious Jewish people eat on Saturday afternoon.
Religious people do not cook on Saturday, so this food must be put on
the stove on Friday, before sunset.  It then cooks overnight,
filling the house with a delicious aroma, until after services
Saturday afternoon.
\fIShabbos\fR means ``Saturday'' in Hebrew,
and \fIchoulnt\fR means ``a mishmosh'' in Yiddish.
(\fIchoulnt\fR in fact comes originally from the French
\fIchaud lent\fR which means ``warm slowly'')
The amount of each ingredient depends on what taste one likes, how
much is available, and the tradition handed down by one's parents
or Rebbitzin (Rabbi's wife).
