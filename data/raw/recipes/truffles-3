(one large package or 3 small packages less a nibble)

.IG "5 oz" "unsweetened chocolate" "150 g"
.IG "" "assorted toppings (cocoa, powdered sugar, crushed nuts, jimmies, etc.)"

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler and add it to the cream cheese
mixture along with the vanilla. Mix well.

Chill for a couple hours. Roll mix into

If you're adventurous, try substituting the liqueur of your choice for the
vanilla.
