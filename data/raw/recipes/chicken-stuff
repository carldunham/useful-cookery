.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHICKEN-STUFF M "20 Feb 86" 1986
.RZ "STUFFED CHICKEN" "Roast chicken stuffed with rice and vegetables"
This is a recipe that I've evolved slowly, and I think I've finally got it
right.
.IH "Serves 2\-3"
.IG "1" "whole chicken,"
with giblets
.IG "\(12 cup" "uncooked white rice" "100 g"
.IG "pinch" "saffron"
(use the amount that sticks to the first
.AB "\(12 inch" "centimeter"
of the tip of a paring knife.)
.IG "2" "celery stalks"
.IG "8\-10" "medium-sized mushrooms"
.IG "2\-3" "scallions"
(depending on size)
.IG "2\-3 Tbsp" "butter" "30\-50 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Pre-heat oven to 
.TE 450 230 .
.SK 2
Clean the chicken\(emremove any large gobs of fat and rinse away any
residual goo from its inside.
.SK 3
Cook the rice in 1 cup of water, along with the saffron.  Salt to taste.
Saut\z\(aae the giblets in about
.AB "2 Tbsp" "25 ml"
of butter.
.SK 4
While these are cooking, clean and cut up the celery, mushrooms, and
scallions into small pieces.
.SK 5
When the giblets are done, chop them well.
.SK 6
Mix the rice, vegetables, and mushrooms together in a bowl, and cram as much
as will fit into the chicken.  Tie the ends of the drumsticks and the tail
together.  Rub about
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 ml"
of butter over the skin of the chicken.
Place remaining stuffing into a glass or ceramic casserole, cover, and
set aside.
.SK 7
Place in the chicken in the oven, uncovered.  After 10 minutes, lower heat to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 8
The chicken should cook approximately
.AB "20 minutes per pound" "45 minutes per kg" .
Test the chicken by pricking it in the thickest part of the thigh; when it
is done, only clear juices will come out. If the chicken is still underdone,
blood will come out.
.SK 9
Half an hour before the chicken is done, put the additional stuffing in
the oven.
.NX
If there are leftovers,
be sure to remove any extra stuffing from the inside of the
chicken, as it will sour if stored inside the bird.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate (cooking time is critical)
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
Approximate measurement OK.
