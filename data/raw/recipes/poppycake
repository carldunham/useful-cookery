.PH
.SK 1
Soak poppyseed in the buttermilk for 15 minutes.
.SK 2
Cream together butter and sugar.
Add yolks to creamed mixture.
Add almond extract or vanilla.
.SK 3
Add dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk mixture,
a little at a time.
.SK 4
Beat egg whites very stiff as for angel food.
Fold egg whites into mixture.

Pour half of this batter mixture into well-greased Bundt pan.

.AB "\(14 cup" "50 g"
brown sugar and
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
cinnamon.
.SK 7
Pour in remaining batter.
.SK 8
Bake at
.TE 350 175
for 1 hour.

Cool and invert onto serving dish, then remove Bundt pan.
.NX
When folding in egg whites, be gentle.
Lift and turn the batter instead of using a stirring motion.
Don't worry if a little bit of egg white remains unmixed;
the egg whites will collapse if you mix it too much.
.PP
I have tried both vanilla and almond extracts with this recipe,
and prefer the former.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate (folding the beaten eggwhites into the batter takes some
skill).
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
.I Precision:
Measure carefully.
