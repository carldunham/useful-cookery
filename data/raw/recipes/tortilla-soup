.SK 1
Combine chicken and water in stockpot.  Add celery seed,
peppercorns and garlic tied in cheesecloth.  Cover, bring
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 45 minutes.
.SK 2
Remove chicken from broth and let cool.  Strain broth
and return to pot.
.SK 3
Add tomatoes, onion, green pepper, cilantro, cumin, cayenne,
white pepper and garlic.  Cover and simmer 30 minutes.
.SK 4
Add corn and green onion.  Simmer 10 minutes.  While this
is cooking, skin and bone the chicken pieces and cut the
meat into bite-size pieces.
.SK 5
Add salt to taste.  Add the chicken, rice and parsley
to the broth, and heat through.
.SK 6
Garnish each bowl with a few crisp tortilla chips (homemade
are best, or those made in a homemade style) and some grated
cheddar cheese.
.NX
I usually make this with leftover chicken.  You don't
actually need a whole chicken worth\(emeven a small amount
will do.  In this case, I use a mixture of chicken broth
and water (about 2/3 chicken broth) for the liquid.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
2 hours, most of it simmering.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
