.RZ "CRANBERRY SAUCE" "Homemade cranberry sauce"
Most people don't realize how easy it is to make cranberry sauce.  It tastes
much better fresh than canned (what doesn't?).
.IH "Makes a lot"

.SK 1
Rinse the cranberries and put them into a heavy pot.  Add just enough water
to cover them.  Stir in the sugar.
.SK 2
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until most of the cranberries
have split open.  This will take about 15 minutes. 
Stir well, then taste it, and add more
sugar if it's not sweet enough for you. If you add more sugar, cook it a
little longer, still stirring, to make sure that the new sugar is completely
dissolved.
.SK 3
Chill overnight.
.SK 4
Eat.
.NX
This keeps covered in the refrigerator for quite a long time.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
Easy
.I Time:
20 minutes preparation, overnight chilling.
.I Precision:
No need to measure.
