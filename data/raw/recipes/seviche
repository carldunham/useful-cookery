.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE SEVICHE  A "10 Dec 86" 1986
.RZ "SEVICHE ACAPULCO" "A tasty marinated fish appetizer from Mexico"
This recipe comes from the \fIDelicias Culinarias\fR cookbook that I
brought from Mexico. The introduction to the recipe reads: ``Seviche is
prepared with raw marinated fish. It is very popular in Ecuador, Peru,
and in the north of Chile. Depending on the region in Mexico, there
exist several different styles to prepare it. This recipe comes
from the Acapulco region''.
.PP
I am sure that you have tasted this appetizer if you have ever been to a
beach in Mexico. It is usually served right where you are ``roasting'' in
the sun or swimming. Yes, the fish in this recipe is raw. However it is
``cooked'' by marinating it in lime juice.
