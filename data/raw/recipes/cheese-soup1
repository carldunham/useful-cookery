.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 375 190 .
Butter a baking sheet.
.SK 2
Prepare pumpkin: cut off the top, scoop out seeds,
brush inside with
.AB "2 Tbsp" "30 g"
melted butter.
Replace top and place pumpkin on baking sheet. Bake 45 mins or until
tender when pierced with a fork.  The pumpkin should be a bit droopy
but still hold its shape well.
.SK 3
Meanwhile, melt
.AB "2 Tbsp" "30 g"
butter in a big saucepan.  Add onion, carrots, celery.
Saut\z\(aae until soft, about 10 mins.  Add broth,
garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Cover, and simmer 20 minutes.  Cool
slightly.
.SK 4
Puree vegetable mixture in 2 or 3 batches in a blender or
food processor.  Put back in saucepan; stir in the cream. Reheat.
Add cheese and wine, heat until cheese melts.  Stir
frequently after adding milk to avoid scorching.
.SK 5
Place hot pumpkin on serving platter. Pour in soup.  Sprinkle with
parsley.
.NX
Serve the soup by ladling out of the pumpkin at the table, scopping a little
bit of pumpkin into each serving. The pumpkin then makes a great centerpiece
for your table, while allowing people to have second helpings.
.PP
I use half greyere and half cheddar.  Shred the cheeses very
finely so they will melt rapidly.
 After the soup is all gone, the pumpkin
can be cut up, washed, and used in pumpkin pie. It may need more
baking to become soft enough to puree for the pies.
.PP
It was impossible
to find pumpkins after Halloween near San Francisco, but
fortunately they keep for a month until Thanksgiving in a cool area
if left uncut.
.PP
In North America, light cream is often called "half and half".
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
1 hour.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
