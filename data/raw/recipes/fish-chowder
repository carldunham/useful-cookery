.RZ "FISH-CHOWDER" "Betty Post's quick fish chowder"
When I left for my first job out of school, my mother was convinced
that I'd starve to death.  She gave me a set of easy recipes on index
cards in hopes that I'd occasionally eat at home instead of Denny's.
This is one of those recipes.  It's quick and easy, and tastes great.
