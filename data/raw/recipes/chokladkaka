.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHOKLADKAKA B "17 Feb 86" 1986
.RZ "SWEDISH CHOCOLATE CAKE" "A rich chocolate Bundt cake"
I got this recipe from my mom, who got it from an American book
called \fI Swedish Baking.\fR I like to make this because it
does not need to be frosted, which makes it an easy dessert.
.IH "one Bundt cake"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "dry bread crumbs" "30 ml"
.IG "1 cup" "shortening" "250 g"
.IG "1 1/2 cup" "sugar" "150 g"
.IG "3" "eggs"
.IG "2 oz" "melted, unsweetened baking chocolate" "60 g"
.IG "2 cups" "cake flour" "180 g"
.IG "2 tsp" "baking powder" "10 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "salt" "5 ml"
.IG "1/4 tsp" "baking soda" "1 ml"
.IG "1 cup" "heavy cream" "250 ml"
.IG "2 tsp" "vanilla extract" "10 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to 
.TE 325 175 .
.SK 2
Butter a Bundt pan and sprinkle with
.AB "2 Tbsp" "30 ml"
dry bread crumbs, until
it is well coated.  This makes a much better crust than flour does.
.SK 3
In a large bowl, add the sugar to the shortening and cream well.
Blend in the eggs, one at a time, and beat well. Stir in the
melted chocolate.
.SK 4
Sift together the dry ingredients.
.SK 5
Combine the cream and vanilla extract. Add to the chocolate
mixture alternately with the dry ingredients, beginning and
ending with the dry ingredients.
.SK 6
Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 50\-60 minutes. Cool
the cake in the pan a few minutes before removing.
.NX
This is not an authentic Swedish recipe because their flour is
different enough to cause problems in baking. However, the
results seem authentic.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
.I Precision:
measure carefully.
