.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHOC-CHIP-4 D "12 Jan 85" 1986
.RZ "CHOCOLATE-CHIP COOKIES" "Cookies like what Mom should have made"
There is no substitute for chocolate-chip cookies,
warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk.
This is Mom's recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe.
This is also \fINestl\z\(aae's\fP ``Toll House'' recipe,
and the \fIJoy of Cooking\fR ``Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies'' recipe,
etc, which is no coincidence.  This is the default recipe.
This is not Mrs. Field's recipe.  If you want Mrs. Field's, use a 
shopping mall; if you want simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip cookies,
use this recipe.
.IH  "12 big cookies"

.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 375 190 .
Sift flour, salt, baking soda together in a small bowl.
.SK 2
In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until smooth.
gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture. Mix in chocolate chips.
.SK 3
Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at
.TE 375 190
for 8\-10
minutes.
.NX
\fIImportant:\fR double all proportions above (always make 2\(mu as much of
these as the recipe calls for).
Let's face it: small is beautiful, but big cookies are \fIbetter\fR than
small ones. All the printed recipes call for teeny cookies, dropped by
teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets (yield 50).
My ``blobs of dough'' are golf-ball sized,
which makes healthy 3\-4 inch cookies.
.PP
I invariably make these on the spur of the moment,
and so usually nuke the butter in a microwave to soften it up.
I also occasionally cheat and soften up the butter/sugar mixture a tad
in the oven.
.PP
Try adding walnuts, macadamias, white chocolate, orange peel,
butterscotch chips, or mint\(emall these are welcome variations.
But keep it simple.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
20 minutes.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
