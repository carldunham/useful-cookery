.SK 1
Peel the apples and and slice them into small wedges.
.SK 2
Beat the eggs until they are foamy, add the sugar gradually and beat well.

Melt the butter in a

coat the pan, and then pour the excess butter into the egg mixture.

Add baking powder and vanilla to egg mixture, mix well, and then
slowly add drained noodles, apples and  raisins.  Mix thoroughly until 
all the noodles have been coated and look gooey.

if you desire, and bake at

until the top looks a little brown and crispy.  The kugel should
feel springy to the touch and not be ``wet''.
.SK 7
Let cool, cut into squares, and serve.

I use Muller's egg noodles.
This feeds about 12 very hungry
people (knoshers, as we call them) or 16 normal ones.  What you don't
eat right away you can wrap in aluminum foil and freeze for a month 
or two.  If it's too sweet for your taste, you can use peaches or other fruit
instead of the raisins.
.PP
Warning: this stuff sits very heavy in the ol' stomach, so don't try
to eat more than 2 pieces in a 24-hour period.  
.PP
Don't thank me, thank my mom.  
.SH RATING
