.RZ "OLD WORLD FRUIT CAKE" "A traditional European-style fruit cake"
Although fruitcakes have a bad reputation, this one is *excellent*.
My mother has been making it for years. She originally got the 
recipe from a friend, but has since adapted it to suit her fans.
(She gets requests for it all year long.)

you can eat; just be sure to wrap it carefully so it doesn't get
freezer burn. Warm frozen cake in the oven, not the microwave.
