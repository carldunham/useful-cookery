.PH "(CURRY)"
.SK 1
Fry the onion in a heavy casserole in the
corn oil until it begins to soften. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and chilies.
.SK 2
Reduce heat and fry gently for awhile.
.SK 3
Meanwhile, toast the
hard seeds and cinnamon in a dry heavy frying pan until they
begin to pop. Grind the toasted seeds into a fine powder and add
to the frying mixture together with the chile powder and the
turmeric.
.SK 4
Add the chopped tinned tomatoes and stir in with
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
salt. If the mixture is dry, add a little water or stock. Cover
and allow to simmer gently for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
.SK 5
Trim the fat off the pre-cooked meat and cut into bite sized
pieces. When the sauce has simmered for the 2 hours, switch off
and stir in the meat. Leave to stand preferably overnight, and
re-heat before eating.
.PH "(RICE)"
.SK 1
Heat corn oil in a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.
Add  cloves, crushed cardamom pods, and cinnamon.
.SK 2
Add rice and turmeric, 
and mix well by swishing the pan round. Add boiling water and bay leaf,
and stir.
.SK 3
Cover and simmer gently for 12\-15 minutes, until all the water has
been absorbed. Use a fork to remove the seeds and bay leaf and
turn out into a warmed dish. Allow to stand in a warm place for
5 to 10 minutes and fluff up with a fork before serving.
.NX
The sauce can be prepared in advance, to use with leftover meat, or you
can cook the meat and sauce to order.
.PP
Plain yoghurt may be substituted for the tomatoes if preferred.
.PP
Experiment with the seasonings.
As a guide, ginger and chile powder
will increase the heat, corriander will increase the sweetness, and
fenugreek and cumin will increase the bitterness.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooking, overnight wait.
.I Precision:
Approximate measurement OK.
