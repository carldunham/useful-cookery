.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE LEFTOVER-SOUP SP "11 Apr 85" 1986
.RZ "END-OF-MONTH VEGETABLE SOUP" "Soup with a mixture of vegetables"
I had an eclectic mixture of vegetables going bad in the refrigerator, so I
collected them and came up with this soup.
It was very good, so I would like to share it with you all.
Caveat: I rarely measure anything, so be careful of quantities.
.IH "Serves 6"
.IG "\(12" "Chinese cabbage"
.IG "\(12" "carrot"
.IG "\(12" "red bell pepper"
.IG "1" "yellow onion"
.IG "4" "potatoes"
(small)
.IG "1/8 lb" "bacon pieces" "40 g"
(for seasoning)
.IG "4" "prosciutto end bits"
(for seasoning\(emoptional)
.IG "5 stalks" "celery"
.IG "1" "bouquet garni"
(e.g., 
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
each of \fIparsley\fP and \fIthyme\fP, 1 or 2 \fIbay leaves\fP)
.IG "2" "chicken or beef bouillon cubes"
(standard size, or 1 \fIKnorr-type\fP 
.AB "[2-cup" "[5-dl"
size] cube)
.IG "2 cloves" "garlic"
.IG "" "pepper"
(to taste)
.IG "1 cup" "white wine" "250 ml"
(optional)
.PH
.SK 1
Make the \fIbouquet garni\fR by tying the herbs up in a cheesecloth or
coffee filter. Put a quart of water to boil with 
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2 ml"
salt (I don't like
to use too much salt if I use bouillon), the \fIbouquet garni\fR, and the
bouillon.
.SK 2
Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and add these to the soup  together with
the bacon and/or prosciutto ends.
.SK 3
Bring this to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes. If scum forms on the surface, skim
it off.
.SK 4
Dice the potatoes and add to the boiling pot.
.SK 5
Cut up everything else and add it. Add the wine.
.SK 6
Adjust the liquid so that it covers the vegetables.
After it boils again, adjust the seasoning and simmer for about an
hour, or until it is done (this is quite subjective).
.NX
This will serve 6 people at once, or 2 people for three days.
It ages well in the refrigerator.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
