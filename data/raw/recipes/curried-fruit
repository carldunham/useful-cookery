.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CURRIED-FRUIT D "30 Oct 86" 1987
.RZ "CURRIED FRUIT" "Baked fruit with curry sauce and nuts"
This dish can be served as a desert, alone, or on top of ice cream or pound
cake (or both!). But, our favorite way of serving it is as a side dish at
brunch on Christmas day. As long as I can remember, Mom has had this dish,
along with an egg/cheese casserole, bacon, and muffins for Christmas brunch.
It is especially easy since you make it a day ahead of time.

Drain all fruit well. Arrange fruit and nuts in

about three-quarters full.

Pour butter mixture over fruit.

I use standard American ``curry powder''. Any other that you
want to use should be ok. Adjust the amount of curry powder to your taste,
or use cinnamon if you really don't like the flavor of curry.
.PP
Use your imagination in choosing the fruits to go in it. Cherries and
almonds are a must, but the rest is up to you. We use canned fruit, but
fresh would be good too.
