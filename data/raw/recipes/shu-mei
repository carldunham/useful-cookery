.PH
.SK 1
Make the dipping sauce by mixing together all of its ingredients. Store in
the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.
.SK 2
Stir together everything but the wrappers and the peanut oil.
Mix vigorously by hand until it begins to bind together.
(About 1 minute or so.)
.SK 3
Place
.AB "1\(12\-2 Tbsp" "25\-30 ml"
of filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper.
Fold the sides up around the meat so that you have a little
bag or cup. Press the bottom flat so that the bag doesn't fall over.
.SK 4
Oil racks of the steamer with peanut oil. Place dumplings in racks.
.SK 5
Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in covered rack over boiling water.
.SK 6
Serve hot with dipping sauce.
.NX
These little gems would probably go just fine with a
favorite hoisin or chili dipping sauce.
.PP
The steamer racks I recommend are the Chinese bamboo ones.
You can stack them quite nicely (I find that three racks work
well) and they sit at just the right height above the boiling water
in a wok.
The real advantage is that water will not condense on your
food if you use a bamboo steamer.
.PP
The dipping sauce is an adaption of one served at the
Phoenix Vietnamese restaurant in Saint Paul Minnesota;
it was originally served with eggrolls, but works splendidly
with these dumplings.
.PP
The original recipe calls for ground pork, but I find ground
turkey preferable.
The flavor is lighter and the calories far fewer.
Pork is fine, though, and even hamburger could be used
in a pinch.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy, but tedious.
.I Time:
45 minutes preparation, 15\-20 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
