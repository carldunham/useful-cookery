.RZ "TARAMOSALATA" "Greek smoked fish-roe pate"
This is a particular family favorite at my parents' house.
The word \fITaramosalata\fR means ``fish egg salad'' in Greek.
.IH "serves 6 "
.IG "\(12 cup" "smoked cod roe" "150 g"
.IG "1 cup" "olive oil" "250 ml"
.IG "1" "garlic clove"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "lemon juice" "30 ml"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "chopped parsley" "5 g"
.IG "1 Tbsp" "finely chopped onion" "10 g"
(or more to taste)
.IG "" "freshly milled black pepper"
.PH
.SK 1

Discard garlic.
.SK 3
Dice roe, add
.AB "2 Tbsp" "30 ml"
oil, and stand for 15 minutes to soften.

adding the remainder of the lemon juice at the half-way stage.
.SK 6
Stir in the chopped onion, parsley and black pepper to taste.
.SK 7

.NX
This recipe can be made with any kind of fish roe. Greeks sometimes add 
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 g"
of cooked potatoes.
.PP
The only tricky bit comes in adding the oil:
you should do it a little at a time like preparing mayonnaise,
and be careful not to let the oil separate.
If it does begin to separate, add another dash of lemon juice.
.PP
Taramosalata will keep for about a week under refrigeration.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:

.I Time:
40 minutes off and on.
