The original recipe said the mushrooms and peapods are optional but I found
that they are a must. The cornstarch and egg white act to seal the moisture
so the chicken does not get dry.  This gives the chicken a very different
texture.  I feel this is the way to stir fry chicken.
But make sure that you do not let the chicken and egg white stand
for more than 5 minutes, otherwise the egg white starts to run.
Raw skinless peanuts are best, but you can also use blanched peanuts.
The hoisin sauce and bean sauce are available at any oriental grocery store
and at some supermarkets.
