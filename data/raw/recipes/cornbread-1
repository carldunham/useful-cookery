.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CORNBREAD-1 B "23 May 86" 1986
.RZ "MEXICAN CORNBREAD" "Corn bread with peppers and cheese"
I got this recipe from net.cooks in the fall of 1983.  It's really good!
We always make a batch of Mexican cornbread when we cook chili; it's also
a good dinner with just a salad and the beer of your choice.
The original recipe came from akgua!akguc!mah.
