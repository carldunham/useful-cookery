.RZ "PAPRIKA MUSHROOM SOUP" "A rich dill, paprika and mushroom soup"
I first saw this at ``Old Wives Tale'', a restaurant in Portland Oregon. The
waiter there said that this had been on the menu every day for a year, and
highly recommended it.  The soup was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to
find a recipe for it in Molly Katzen's \fIMoosewood Cookbook\fR.
