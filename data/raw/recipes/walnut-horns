.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE WALNUT-HORNS D "6 Oct 86" 1987
.RZ "WALNUT HORNS" "Rolled, walnut-filled cookies
This recipe has been in the family for a while.
These cookies make great Christmas gifts.
.IH "makes about 60 cookies"
.IG "2 cups" "flour" "200 g"
.IG "1 cup" "butter" "250 g"
.IG "8 oz" "sour cream" "225 g"
.IG "1" "egg yolk"
.IG "1 cup" "brown sugar" "200 g"
.IG "1 cup" "ground walnuts" "115 g"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "cinnamon" "2.5 ml"
.IG "" "butter"
.PH 
.SK 1       
Cream the flour and butter.
.SK 2
Mix in the sour cream and the egg yolk.
.SK 3
Divide the dough into four parts, wrap in plastic wrap, and
chill for several hours.
.SK 4
Mix together the brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon.
.SK 5
Roll each dough section on a floured surface until about
.AB "1/8 inch" "3 mm"
thick.
.SK 6
Spread about \(14 of the sugar/walnut/cinnamon mixture over each rolled
dough section. Cut the dough into pie-shaped wedges and roll, beginning at the
wide end.
.SK 7
Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Brush with melted butter
.AB "(2 Tbsp" "(30 g"
should be enough).
.SK 8
Bake for about 20 minutes at
.TE 375 190 .
If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn brown,
the dough will be softer and flakier.
If you remove them after they have browned slighly, the dough
will be crisper.
.SK 9
Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled
completely, or else they stick to the cookie sheet.
.NX            
During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful.
However, now they strike me as a bit sweet.
You could probably decrease the amount of brown sugar by \(14 to
\(12 and make up for the loss in volume by increasing the amount of nuts.
