.SK 1
Cream the butter and sugars, then add oil and mix well.
.SK 2
Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well.
.SK 3
Sift the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt together,
then add to above and mix well.
.SK 4
Refrigerate overnight, or until dough is firm.  If you want to
speed this up, put the dough in the freezer, but keep an eye on it.
.SK 5
Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 6
Drop dough in
.AB "\(12tsp" "3ml"
amounts on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Dip a glass in dough and wipe excess off.  Then dip the glass in
sugar and flatten a cookie.  Repeat the dip-in-sugar flatten-cookie
sequence until all are done.  The cookies won't spread in baking,
so you can easily judge how far apart to put them  (you want room
to cook, but not to grow).  If you find that the dough is getting
too soft to flatten easily, put it in the refrigerator between
batches.
.SK 7
Bake for about 5\-6 minutes, until the edges are JUST beginning
to turn golden brown.  Take off the cookie sheet and put on
waxed paper or foil to cool.
.NX
You can add
.AB "2\-3 Tbsp" "30\-40 ml"
cocoa to about
.AB "1\(12 cups" "500 g"
dough for chocolate cookies, or add cinnamon to the dipping sugar
for spice cookies.  I like the sugar cookies plain, so
I've never actually tried this.
.PP
These cookies don't freeze well, because they pick up the flavors of the
other things in the freezer. Make only as many as you can eat before they go
stale.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 8 or more hours in refrigerator, 30 minutes final
preparation and baking.
.I Precision:
Measure the ingredients.
