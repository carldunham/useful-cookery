.RZ "AMBROSIA" "Simple desert for failed Pavlova attempts"
My mother used to make the banana variety of this when she cooked
her meringues a little too long or too hot.
I've no idea of its origins.
.IH "serves 4"
.IG "1\(14 cups" "heavy cream" "300 ml"
.IG "2" "bananas"
(or equivalent amount of some soft fruit)
.IG "" "broken meringue"
.PH
.SK 1
Whip the cream.
.SK 2
Chop fruit coarsely, but don't crush.
.SK 3
Break meringue into large crumbs.
.SK 4
Mix everything shortly before serving and pile into glasses.
.NX
I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the banana
version.
Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never tried it.
.PP
This is a neat way of saving a
.IR Pavlova (D)
attempt when the meringue part fails:
it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever know...
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
very simple.
.I Time:
10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
.I Precision:
No need to measure.
