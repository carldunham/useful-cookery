.RZ "PHEASANT A LA MODE PERRY" "Pheasant for Thanksgiving"
A couple of years ago, we decided that pheasant would be the perfect
Thanksgiving meal for two.  My husband conflated the best parts of 
all the pheasant recipes we could find (most came from the
.I Gourmet
cookbook)
and came up with a recipe that I find wonderful.  It's moist and tender;
tastes like chicken gone to heaven.   (One of pheasant's main problems,
by the way, is that it tends to be dry.)

.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 2
Rub pheasant inside and out with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with
port.
Stuff with bay leaf, cloves, garlic, parsley, celery leaves, lemon, juniper
berries and tangerine.
.SK 3
Sew the body cavity of the pheasant shut. Moisten the larding pork or bacon
with port, and cover the breast.
.SK 4 
To the roasting pan add onion slices,
mushroom peelings,
.AB "1 cup" "250 ml"
of port, chicken stock, salt to taste, peppercorns,
more juniper berries to taste, and Mandarine liqueur.
.SK 5
Roast 40\-45 minutes, basting every 10 minutes at least.
.SK 6
Strain gravy.  Let stand and skim fat.  Just before serving, add 
sour cream.
.NX
(We usually stick the whole cloves into the tangerine, insert all
the other spices into the body cavity, then add the tangerine.)
.PP 
Some of these ingredients may be hard to find; feel free to omit them.
``Mushroom peelings'' are simply mushroom stems and leftovers, chopped fine.
``Bruised peppercorns'' are peppercorns that have been hit with a wooden
mallet.
Bon appetit, and good luck!
