.SK 1 
Lightly roast the cumin seed and coriander seed by frying with no oil for
a minute or so, stirring constantly.
Grind these and combine them
into a paste with the other spices, the garlic, ginger, and the vinegar.
.SK 2 
Add the lamb to the marinade and mix well.  Refrigerate for 3\-24 hours while
mixing every few hours as convenient.
.SK 3
Finely chop the onions and potatoes and saut\z\(aae them for 5 minutes in the
butter.
.SK 4
Add lamb and spice paste and simmer over low heat for half an hour.
.NX
The marinating does add a lot of flavor and makes the meat much more tender.
This can be skipped if need be.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy (though it's easy to burn the spices while roasting them).
.I Time:
1 hour preparation, 1 day marinating, 1 hour cooking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
