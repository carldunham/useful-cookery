.RZ "HOPKINS NEOLITHIC EGG NOG" "Traditional layered eggnog with bourbon and dark rum"
This is the egg nog that was served at the Hopkins Neolithic Xmas Party, a
party that some friends used to have every year. We now serve it for our
Winter Solstice celebration. It's purported to come from the original Fanny
Farmer Cookbook.

nog by stirring gently every day.
