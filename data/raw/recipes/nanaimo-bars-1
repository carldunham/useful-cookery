.RZ "NANAIMO BARS I" "A Favorite Canadian sweet"
This comes from a page in an obscure magazine called something like
\fICanadian Homemaker\fR, by way of a Canadian friend, Steve Deering.  This
is a traditional Canadian sweet, much loved and admired. The origin of the
recipe seems to be lost in the mists of time, though everyone seems to agree
that it comes from the town of Nanaimo, in British Columbia.
