.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BROWNIES-2 D "8 Aug 87" 1987
.RZ "BROWNIES II" "Serious chocolate brownies"
This is an adaptation of the ``Scrumptious Brownies''
recipe found on a box of Baker's unsweetened chocolate.
I've reduced the amounts of sugar and flour from the
original, which I find makes for a very fudgey brownie.
