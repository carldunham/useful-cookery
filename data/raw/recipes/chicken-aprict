.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHICKEN-APRICT M "5 Aug 86" 1986
.RZ "APRICOT CHICKEN" "Chicken embalmed in apricot nectar"
Apricot Chicken is the ultimate bachelors delight.
It is very simple and tastes wonderful.
The recipe was given to me by a group of friends from back home who came to
visit me.
.IH "Serves 4\-6"
.IG "2 lb" "chicken pieces" "1 kg"
.IG "1 pkg" "French onion soup mix"
.IG "2 cups" "apricot nectar" "0.5 l"
.IG "1\(12 lb" "canned apricot halves" "850 g"
.IG "" "plain flour"
.PH
.SK 1
Dust chicken in flour.
.SK 2
Fry chicken lightly until starting to brown.
.SK 3
Place chicken in a casserole dish or a very deep frying pan.
Add soup powder, nectar and apricots.
Mix everything well.
.SK 4
Simmer for 1 hour.
.NX
I normally use 2 pieces of chicken per person and
.AB "a 1\(12 lb" "an 850 g"
can of apricot halves. This will suffice for 4 to 6 people.
If you cannot get nectar, then use the juice from the apricot halves.
(Of course, if you can buy apricots in nectar ...)
.PP
The French onion soup quantity is not critical, but a soup packet that makes up
.AB "6 cups" "1.5 litres"
is about right for 4 to 6 people.
.PP
Serve with potato (baked or boiled), buttered carrots, and peas.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
.I Precision:
No need to measure.
