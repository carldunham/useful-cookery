.RZ "FRENCH CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE" "A decadently rich chocolate cake"
My mother got this recipe from a radio show about ten years ago.  
She was intrigued because the cake contains no flour.
It is definitely for chocoholics.
Although it is a two-layer cake, it is only about
.AB "3\-4 inches" "7\-10 cm"
thick when it's done, and has the consistency and density of a
chocolate candy bar.  It can be frozen if you find it too
much to eat at one time.
.IH "one cake"
.SH		CAKE

Combine espresso, hot water, semisweet chocolate, and bitter
chocolate in double boiler filled with hot water and cover.
Without applying additional heat, melt the chocolate.
.SK 2
Butter two layer-cake pans, lay a sheet of waxed paper in each,
and dust the pans with flour.
(The pans should be able to hold

each.)
.SK 3
Beat the egg yolks and then gradually add 
.AB "2/3 cup" "125 g"
of sugar until the yolks are thick and lemon colored.

Add the chocolate mixture to the egg yolks and stir.

Add the cream of tartar, and then gradually add up to 
.AB "2 Tbsp" "25 g"
sugar.
.SK 6
Add the sifted corn starch gradually to the chocolate mixture,
alternating with the egg whites.
The corn starch and egg whites should be folded in to the
chocolate mixture.
.SK 7
Pour half the batter into each cake pan.
.SK 8
Bake on the lower middle level of a preheated
.TE 350 175
oven until set on the sides.
