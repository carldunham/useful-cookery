.RZ "DOG BISCUITS" "Homemade meatless dog biscuits"
This strange and wonderful recipe appeared in our hometown paper's consumer
column, for making doggie Christmas presents! Although they are meatless,
they are not vegetarian, as they contain chicken broth. However, your
dog is quite unlikely to be a strict vegetarian.
