.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BRAN-MUFFINS-2 D "16 Apr 87" 1988
.RZ "BRAN MUFFINS" "Tasty muffins with bran and dried fruit"
This is a simple New Zealand recipe based on "golden syrup".  The muffins
make a delicious alternative to scones.  We eat them buttered, either hot or
cold.  I've added the dried fruit to the original recipe as it makes them
much more interesting.

Golden syrup is a very thick sugar syrup that is readily available in
countries where people drive on the left-hand side of the road,
but seems to be rare elsewhere. If the
gourmet section of your supermarket does not carry it, you could try
substituting some kind of honey, such as sage honey.
.PP
Any dried fruit can be used instead of sultanas, e.g. raisins, dates -
whatever strikes your fancy.
