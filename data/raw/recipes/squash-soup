.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE SQUASH-SOUP SP "4 Dec 87" 1988
.RZ "BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP" "Makes a meal with cheese, bread, and red wine."
Here is a rich soup which is easy to make and popular with guests.  I like
this best with cheese, bread and red wine as a winter meal, but you can
serve it as a first course.  The original recipe came from
\fIFood & Wine\fR magazine a couple of years ago.

.PH
.SK 1
Melt the butter over moderate heat in a large heavy saucepan.  Add the
onion and rosemary.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the onion is soft.
.SK 2
Add the squash, chicken stock, cream, salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce.
Reduce the heat and cover.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 2
hours until the squash is very soft.
.SK 3
Use a food processor or blender to puree the hot soup.  Add additional
stock if the soup is too thick.
.SK 4
Toast and chop the walnuts.  Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the
walnuts.
.SH NOTES
As a variation, you may chop some or all of the walnuts in the food
processor or blender while the soup is pureed.  This will give the soup a
slightly different taste and texture.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooking.
.I Precision:
measure the hot pepper sauce.
