Freeze. When relatively hard, coat one side with buttercream

One side of the pancakes may burn. It doesn't particularly affect
the taste, and if you frost this side, no one will even know.

It's not necessary to cook the pancakes completely; if the middle
looks somewhat gooey, don't fret: it will soon harden.

easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to frost.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
