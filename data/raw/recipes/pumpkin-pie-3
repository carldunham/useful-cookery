.RZ "PUMPKIN PIE III" "A Pumpkin Pie with flour"
This is my mother's recipe for her traditional Thanksgiving dinner pumpkin
pie.  It is different from most other pumpkin pie recipes in that flour
and brown sugar are used in the batter.  Even my wife, who is not a big
pumpkin pie fan, thought this was a yummy pie.
.PP
When my parents first got married, every pumpkin pie my mom made for my
dad was rejected with the comment ``it's not like mother used to make.''
She even tried to use his mother's recipe, but she could not follow it:
his mother used ordinary kitchen utensils for measuring devices (like
a teacup for a ``cup,'' a real table spoon for a ``tablespoon,'' etc.).
She finally found a recipe that looked similar to grandma's.  Through the
years she has altered it slightly to make the pie even more tastier.

Don't be surprised if the pie rises slightly.  It will go down again after
it cools.
.PP
Make sure you get just pumpkin.  Don't use a can of ``pumpkin pie mix''
instead!  If you were very ambitious, you could gut a pumpkin yourself for
this recipe, but I have never had the time or courage to do that.
.PP
You can buy a pie shell crust or you can make your own.  Certainly, the
results are better when you make your own.
.PP
Light brown sugar can be used instead of dark, but the result isn't as good.
