.PH "CHICKEN"
.SK 1
Preheat oven to 
.TE 375 190 .
.SK 2
Combine breadcrumbs, cheese and parsley.  Saut\z\(aae chopped bacon and drain
on absorbent paper.  Add the bacon to the breadcrumb mix.
This is the crumb topping for the chicken.
.SK 3
In a pan, melt the butter, then add the crushed garlic, Worcestershire sauce
and mustard.  Mix and heat through.
.SK 4
Coat the chicken fillets with the butter mixture by dipping them
in the saucepan.  Arrange in a shallow, ovenproof dish.  Press the
breadcrumb mixture on top of the chicken pieces to provide a crumb
topping.
.SK 5
Bake uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes.
.SK 6
While the chicken cooks, make the basil sauce:
in a saucepan combine all sauce ingredients except the egg yolk.
Stir until heated and then add the egg yolk, stirring until thickened. 
Do not boil. Pour the hot sauce over the chicken pieces just before serving.
.NX
The sauce sounds unusual but tastes great. The fresh basil gives it a good
green colour. Serve with green, vegetables, such as beans and
snow peas, or a leafy green salad for a colour-coordinated dinner.
.PP
The finer the ingredients in the topping the better will be its effect.
