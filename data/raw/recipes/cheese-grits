Editor's note: grits are ground or cracked hominy. Hominy is an American
Indian food, which is made from dried corn. There is virtually no substitute
for it, and it is hard to get outside North America. It is a very popular
food in the southern U.S.  In parts of Mexico it is known as "nixtamal" or
sometimes "pozole".
