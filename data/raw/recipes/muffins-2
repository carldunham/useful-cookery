.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE MUFFINS-2 B "17 Aug 87" 1987
.RZ "BRAN MUFFINS" "Very rich and moist muffins with bran, raisins, nuts, and dates"
I experimented a lot to find the ultimate bran muffin recipe.
I started with a recipe from the \fIBetty Crocker Cookbook\fR, but
I've changed it enough that I'm willing to take all the credit
for it.
.IH "12 large muffins"
.IG "1" "egg"
.IG "1\(34 cups" "cream" "420 ml"
.IG "\(34 cups" "vegetable oil" "180 ml"
.IG "1 cup" "wheat bran" "60 g"
.IG "1 Tbsp" "baking powder" "15 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "salt" "5 ml"
.IG "1 cup" "dark molasses" "250 ml"
.IG "\(34 cup" "whole wheat flour" "100 g"
.IG "\(34 cup" "rice flour" "120 g"
.IG "1/3 cup" "uncooked oatmeal" "30 g"
.IG "1 cup" "chopped nuts" "100 g"

.SK 1
Preheat the oven to
.TE 350 175 .
Grease the bottoms of your muffin pan.
Chop the nuts and dates.
.SK 2
Beat the egg, then add to it cream and oil.  Mix this
together well, then mix in the bran and let it sit there and
absorb liquid for about five minutes.
.SK 3
In another large bowl measure and slightly blend the wheat and
rice flour and the oatmeal.
.SK 4
Now that it's been about five minutes, add the baking powder,
salt, and molasses to the soaking bran and mix thoroughly.
.SK 5
Dump the bran mixture into the flour mixture and blend a bit,
then fold in the nuts, raisins, and dates.  Try not to mix too
much because overmixing can degrade the texture of the muffins.
.SK 6
Fill muffin tins about to the top and bake at
.TE 350 175 
for about 25 minutes.
.NX
You can use milk instead of cream, but the muffins will not
be as rich and moist.
.PP
Using 1/3 hazelnuts and 2/3 walnuts adds a distinctive flavor.
.PP
I like to let the batter sit in the refrigerator for a while
(a few hours to overnight) before I bake it.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking and cooling.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
