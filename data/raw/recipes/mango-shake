.RZ "MANGO MILK SHAKE" "A refreshing Indian summer drink"

This is a delicious, refreshing, and easy-to-make drink for hot summer days.

of milk,

.NX
Canned mango pulp is available in Indian and Latin American grocery stores.
The ``mango nectar'' that is widely available in American grocery stores
does not have nearly enough mangoes per unit volume to make this drink.
If you are lucky enough to be able to get fresh mangoes, you can use the
flesh of one ripe mango for about 
.AB "1 cup" "100 g"
of the mango pulp; if you do that, increase the amount of sugar to 
.AB "2 Tbsp" "15 g"
per batch, as canned mango pulp always has added sugar.
.PP
You can make interesting variations on this recipe by using plain yogurt for
some or all of the milk, and by adding a tart counterbalance to the mangoes,
such as shredded kiwifruit.
.SH RATING
