.SK 1
Cream together butter, sugar and eggs in one bowl. 
In another bowl, mix the
dry ingredients together (flour, salt, soda and seasonings). 
Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture half at a time, alternating it
with the applesauce. 
Pick all the black gumdrops out and eat them or throw them away.
Add the nuts, raisins, coconut, and remaining gumdrops; blend well.
.SK 2
Line 2 large loaf pans or 5 small loaf pans with \fIwax paper\fR! (Grease
won't work). 
Fill pans about 2/3 full. 
Bake at
.TE 300 150
for about 2 hours. 
Let cool for about 15 minutes before you try to remove the 
loaves from the pan. They should just fall right out when turned upside down,
then peel off the wax paper.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food processor is tedious.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 15 minutes cooling.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
.NX
The smaller gumdrops work best when you go to cut the cake. I can
never find small gumdrops that are not 'spice drops', so I buy the large
ones and cut them into quarters. The cake also slices a lot better when
almost entirely cool. If you try to cut a piece while it's still hot, it'll
taste GREAT, but it will crumble all over.
