.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE YAM-CURRY V "21 Apr 86" 1986
.RZ "YAM CURRY" "Yams in yogurt and spices\(emgood lamb curry substitute"
The yams in this dish are cooked in a sauce very much like that traditionally
used for meat. Serve with chapatis and rice. The recipe is derived from
one in \fIThe Hamlyn Curry Cookbook\fR, by Meera Taneja, which I 
recommend highly.

Meanwhile, finely chop the onion, ginger, and garlic, and roughly chop the
tomatoes. Heat the il over a moderate flame, add the cumin seed, and cook

splutter. Add the chopped onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook until the onion
is a rich golden color. Add all the spices and season with salt to taste. 
Cook a few seconds more, and then add the tomatoes. Let this cook while you
continue as below.
