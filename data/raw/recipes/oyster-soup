.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE OYSTER-SOUP SP "12 Nov 85" 1986
.RZ "ARTICHOKE OYSTER SOUP" "Chicken broth with artichokes and poached oysters"
This is a modern cajun-style recipe that I adapted from a local
convenience-food cookbook by Jean Durkee.
It's an intriguing combination of modern
American ingredients with traditional cajun flavorings.
.IH "Serves 6"
.IG "6 Tbsp" "butter," "90 g"
melted.
.IG "\(12 cup" "shallots" "120 g"
(chopped fine)

.IG "\(12 tsp" "cayenne pepper" "2.5 ml"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "flour" "30 ml"
.IG "14 oz" "chicken broth" "400 ml"
(more or less won't hurt)
.IG "4 cups" "oysters" "1 l"
Drained; reserve liquid. Or use less, to taste.
.IG "14 oz" "cooked artichoke hearts" "400 g"
.IG "2 tsp" "salt" "10 ml"

.PH
.SK 1
In a 
.AB "3-quart" "3-liter"
casserole, melt butter and saut\z\(aae shallots. When shallots are
translucent, add thyme, bay leaf, and cayenne pepper.
Add flour and whisk well.
.SK 2
Add broth, oyster water, artichoke hearts, salt, and tabasco. Bring to a
boil.
.SK 3
Add oysters and parsley. Simmer on medium, partly covered, for exactly
5 minutes. Add whipped cream and serve immediately.
.NX
Fresh parsley tastes much better than dried parsley.
If the oysters are bigger than a small bite-size, cut them up before adding
them to the soup. Use the smallest oysters you can find.
.PP
When I'm not making a double recipe, I usually dump the entire 
.AB "1-cup" "250-ml"
container of whipping cream into the soup, even though that's double what
the recipe calls form.
.PP
The timing on cooking the oysters is fairly critical.
If you overcook them, they will be rubbery.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
20 minutes.
.I Precision:
measure the spices.
