.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE VEG-SOUP-1 SPV "3 Dec 85" 1986
.RZ "WINTER VEGETABLE SOUP" "A rich vegetable soup for cold weather"
I submitted this recipe to a local paper for a cooking contest a few
winters back. The recipe won an honorable mention in the Staten
Island Advance. I make it at least twice a winter.
It is very rich, and something my family looks forward to.
