.RZ "PUMPKIN SCONES" "Pumpkin scones"

accompaniment to afternoon tea. They are often served with jam and whipped
cream. In this variation the scones are flavoured with pumpkin. It
is not a typical scone recipe.
.PP
Pumpkin scones can be eaten in place of bread with a meal.

To an Australian, a pumpkin is a large round, squat, green or blue-green
vegetable that is orange on the inside. There are many varieties, all of
species \fICucurbita maxima\fR. In North America a good substitute is
acorn squash (\fICucurbita pepo\fR); elsewhere a butternut squash
(\fICaryoka nuciferum\fR) would be a fair substitute.
