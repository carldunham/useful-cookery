.SK 1
Put the beans, ham hocks, water and salt in a kettle, and bring to a boil.  
Cover and let simmer 2 to 2\(12 hours, or
until beans are thoroughly tender.
.SK 2
Remove the ham hocks and set aside.
.SK 3
Drain the beans, and reserve both them and the cooking liquid.  There should 
be about 
.AB "6 cups" "1.5 liters"
of beans and
.AB "4 cups" "1 liter"
of liquid.  Add enough broth to the liquid to make
.AB "6 cups" "1.5 liters" .
.SK 4
Put the beans in the container of a food processor or blender, and blend as 
thoroughly as possible.  Add a little of the liquid and continue blending.  
Combine the pur\z\(aaeed beans and remaining liquid in a large bowel.

Heat the oil in a heavy kettle, and add the peppers, onions, garlic and 
cumin.  Cook, stirring, until the onions are wilted.  Add the tomatoes and 
the vinegar.  Let simmer about 15 minutes.
