.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE ZUCCHINI-GING V "2 Jun 86" 1986
.RZ "ZUCCHINI SHREDS WITH GINGER" "Zucchini with ginger and chili peppers"
This is a nice spicy vegetable dish.  It goes well with fish, especially
catfish.  I've always used zucchini, though it works as well with carrots or
cucumbers. You can serve it as an appetizer or as a side dish, hot or cold.

The recipe is originally from \fITravel & Leisure\fR magazine.

.SK 1
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over high heat for 3 minutes.
.SK 2
Add the cumin, let the oil darken slightly (about 10 seconds)
and add ginger and chili.  Cook for 30 seconds, stirring frequently.
.SK 3
Add the zucchini and stir-fry for 3\-4 minutes.
Add tomato during the last 2 minutes of cooking.
.SK 4
Turn off the heat.
Sprinkle lemon juice and salt to taste, mix, transfer to a serving plate and
garnish with coriander.
.NX
I've found that this recipe works best if you use small zucchini, so that each
slice has some peel (skin?) attached.  Center slices without peel/skin 
fall apart.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
