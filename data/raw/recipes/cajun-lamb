.SK 1
Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 2
Mix together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb.  Let
stand for 15 minutes.
.SK 3
Heat oil in a skillet.  Sear the lamb until all sides are
browned.  Remove lamb to a roasting pan.
.SK 4
Roast lamb for 35 to 40 minutes.
.SK 5
While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet
used for searing the lamb.  Saut\z\(aae until soft.
.SK 6
Add tomatoes, chicken stock, basil, lemon, and chili powder. 
Bring to a boil, and add the rice.  Reduce heat and simmer until
liquid is absorbed.
.NX
Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged piece of
meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice mix to
cover all the surfaces.  You will be slicing up the roast before
serving anyhow.
