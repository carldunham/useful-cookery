.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CELERY-SALAD SL "6 Feb 87" 1987
.RZ "CELERY ROOT SALAD" "Cooked celery root in vinaigrette"
This salad has an intense celery flavor.
The taste is so strong that it should be served only with other strongly
flavored foods. It would overwhelm veal, but would go well with a lamb roast.

.AB "\(12-inch" "1-cm"
cubes.
.SK 2
Add the cubed celery root to the boiling salted water and cook
until tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain.
.SK 3
Combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk or shake to make a dressing.
.SK 4
Pour the dressing over the cooked celery root and toss. Refrigerate at least
two hours before serving.
.NX
Celery root (also called celeriac) is sometimes hard to find. Try to get
ones about the size of a large fist; smaller ones have too much waste, and
bigger ones are often pithy. This vegetable is not worth eating raw.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
