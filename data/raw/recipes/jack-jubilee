.RZ "JACK JUBILEE" "A casserole made with jack cheese"
I got this recipe from the National Dairy Council.
It's good winter food: easy to make, and rich.
.PP
Don't let the corn chips put you off;
normally, such an ingredient would make me think it's one of those recipes
for people who don't like to cook and don't care about good food.
Take my word for it: this recipe is an exception.

Ingredient notes for non-US cooks: \fIMonterey Jack\fR cheese is a bland
American cheddar from Monterey, California. Try substituting Dunlop
(Scottish), Lancashire (English), or Cantal (French). \fIHalf and half\fR is
a dairy product that is 50% whole milk and 50% heavy cream; light cream
makes a reasonable substitute. Corn chips, often sold as ``Fritos'' or
``Doritos'', are a packaged snack food made of deep-fried pressed cornmeal.
I cannot think of any reasonable substitute for them in this recipe. [Ed.]
