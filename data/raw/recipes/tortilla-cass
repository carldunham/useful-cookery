.RZ "BEEFY TORTILLA CASSEROLE" "A simple Mexican-style casserole with beef and cheese"
This a conglomeration of several of my favorite Mexican casserole
recipes.  I took what I liked best from each one and this
is what it turned out to be.  My family devoured it instantly and 
completely, and it has become one of our favorites.

Put approx. 1/3 of the meat mixture in the casserole dish followed by
a layer of tortillas, cheese, and olives.  Repeat twice.
Sprinkle crushed corn chips around the edges and bake at
.TE 350 175
for 20 minutes or until heated through.  Cut into wedges.

You can adjust the seasonings to suit your own tastes; I listed
conservative amounts (for me, anyway!).  You can also add salsa
(homemade is best) to the casserole, if desired.  Serve with 
fried rice (plain or flavored) and green salad.
