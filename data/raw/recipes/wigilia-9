.SK 1
Make the dough: soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl.
.SK 2
Mix flour with sugar and salt.  Cut in the butter until mixture has a fine,
even crumb.
.SK 3
Beat eggs and extra yolks; mix with yeast, then stir into the flour mixture.
Add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well.
.SK 4
Knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes.  Divide in half and roll each
half into a 12 inch square. Cover.
.SK 5
Make the filling: melt butter in a large pan.  Add poppy seed and stir-fry
for 3 minutes.
.SK 6
Add honey, lemon juice, and raisins to poppy seeds.  Cover and remove from heat.
Let stand for 10 minutes.
.SK 7
Beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form.
Fold in orange and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture.
.SK 8
Spread half of the filling on each dough square (after you uncover them).
Roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges.  Place on greased
baking sheets and cover.  Let rise until doubled in bulk (approx. 1\(12
hours).
.SK 9
Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
Bake about 45 minutes, then remove from oven and cool.
.SK 10
Make the icing: mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Spread this
mixture evenly over the rolls.
.NX
You can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle. Specialty food stores sell
grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds. Some spice shops sell poppy
seeds already ground, but like all spices they lose their freshness much more
rapidly after they are ground. This year (1987) in Poland, the people are
having a very hard time finding enough poppy seeds for their \fIstrucle z
makiem\fR because there is a government crackdown on the growing of all
poppies in an attempt to control opium production.
.SH RATING
