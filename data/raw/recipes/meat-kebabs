.RZ "SPICY KEBABS" "Spicy pork or lamb kebabs"
I copied this from a newspaper or magazine a long time ago; I forget where.
It was originally for pork, but it's good with lamb too.

.SK 1
Grate the onions. This is best done using a food processor.  Mincing
is not good enough; you want to end up with something wet and mushy.
Don't stick your nose into the food processor.
.SK 2
Put all the ingredients into a large bowl, mix well, and cover.
.SK 3
Refrigerate for several hours, mixing occasionally.
.SK 4
Put meat cubes on skewers, keeping as much of the onion mixture on them as
you can.
.SK 5
Grill over hot coals, turning to brown each side, for 20 to 25 minutes
or until meat is cooked through.  (Lamb should still be slightly pink;
pork should not.)
.NX
You could probably put some vegetables (onions, bell peppers) on the
skewers between the meat chunks; watch out that the veggies don't
burn.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation,
several hours marinating,
30 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
Approximate measurement OK.
