.RZ "HOBEE'S COFFEE CAKE" "Coffee cake from Hobee's Haven restaurant"
``Hobee's Haven'' here in Silicon Valley (usually just called ``Hobee's'')
serves a lot of brunch food, and as far as I can tell they always include a
piece of their coffee cake with each order.  Frankly, I don't care for
breakfast, nor do I approve of places at which the only kind of tea you can
order reeks of orange and cinammon ... but the coffee cake is pretty good.
This is their recipe, printed in an advertising flyer for the shopping center
they inhabit; it's quite easy.

.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 2
In a large mixing bowl,
.AB "resift" "sift"
flour with baking power, baking soda, salt, and
.AB "1 cup" "200 g"
of sugar.
.SK 3
In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, sour cream, and vanilla.
.SK 4
Add egg mixture to flour mixture and beat until smooth.
.SK 5
Oil a
.AB "9-inch" "22-cm"
square baking pan (you can also use an
.AB "8 inch" "20-cm"
square pan, or anything of similar surface area, if you increase
the baking time by about 5 minutes).
.SK 6
Spread the batter in the pan.  If you are using fruit or nuts, scatter
them over the batter and stir a little bit so that they stay in the top
layer.
.SK 7
In a small bowl, mix
.AB "5 Tbsp" "60 g"
sugar with the butter and cinammon with a sturdy fork, until they are
blended and resemble cornmeal (i.e., you should have a mixture of
fine crumbs, not a smooth mixture).
.SK 8
Sprinkle topping over batter.
.SK 9
Bake for 20\-25 minutes, until a clean toothpick inserted in the center of
the cake comes out dry.
.SK 10
Cool slightly; serve warm or at room temperature.  Don't ruin it by
serving it with salted butter.
.NX
All ingredients and bowls should be a room temperature before you start;
this is particularly true for the butter.
