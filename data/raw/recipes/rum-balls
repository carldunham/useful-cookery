.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE RUM-BALLS D "23 Dec 85" 1986
.RZ "RUM/BOURBON BALLS" "Intoxicating chocolate snack with rum or bourbon"
I got this from my mom who uses more alcohol than the original
recipe called for but less than I like to use.  It makes a great
party snack.
.IH "Makes about 30 small balls"
.IG "3 cups" "vanilla wafers" "250 g"
(crushed)
.IG "1 cup" "powered sugar" "130 g"
.IG "1 1/2 cups" "chopped nuts" "180 g"
.IG "1 1/2 Tbsp" "cocoa powder" "25 ml"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "white corn syrup" "30 ml"
(honey also works well)
.IG "1/2 cup" "rum or bourbon" "100 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Mix all dry ingredients and set aside.
.SK 2
Mix corn syrup or honey with rum or bourbon to thin the syrup.
.SK 3
Blend wet mixture into dry ingredients with fork.  Mix well. 
Allow to sit for 1\-2 hours.
.SK 4
At this point, if you let it sit a couple of hours, you can come 
back and add another
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 ml"
of rum or bourbon and let sit again.
This process may be repeated a few times to your taste.  The last
time, the mix should sit a couple of hours so it's not \fIreally\fR moist.
There's a good midpoint between too moist and too dry where rolling
into balls won't be difficult (too wet) or cause crumbling (too dry).
.SK 5
Roll into balls, then roll in powered sugar to make a sugar coating.
.NX
When rolling in powered sugar, the moister they are, the more sugar
will be absorbed over time.  They may need another roll in
the sugar right before serving.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty: 
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
\(12 to 1 hour preparation; 3 or more hours waiting.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
