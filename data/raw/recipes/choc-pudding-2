.RZ "CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING" "chocolate bread pudding with cinnamon"
.PP
This recipe originally came from
\fIChocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate\fR
by Barbara Myers. I have modified it somewhat.
.IH "4\-6 servings"
.IG "6 oz" "semisweet or white chocolate, melted" "180 g"
.IG "\(12 cup" "granulated sugar" "100 g"
.IG "\(14 tsp" "salt" "1 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "ground cinnamon" "5 ml"
.IG "1\(12 cup" "milk" "4 dl"
.IG "2" "eggs,"
lightly beaten
.IG "2\(12 cups" "bread cubes" "200 g"
(small, firm, and fresh)
.PH
.SK 1
Butter four 1-cup ramekins or six custard cups and place them on
a cookie sheet.
Preheat oven to
.TE 400 200 .
.SK 2
Combine the melted chocolate,
sugar,
salt,
and cinnamon.
.SK 3
Stir the milk in slowly and then add the eggs.
Beat the entire mixture with a whisk until well blended.
.SK 4
Stir in the bread cubes
and let them soak for a few minutes.
Beat the pudding with a whisk again.
The bread cubes should fall apart somewhat.
.SK 5
Divide the pudding between the ramekins or custard cups and put them,
cookie sheet and all,
into the oven.
.SK 6
Bake for 15 minutes or until the edges look done
(spongey,
like a cake)
and the middle is just under done.
.SK 7
Cool for 15 minutes and serve or
cool completely,
wrap,
and store in the refrigerator.
They will keep for 3 to 4 days,
at least,
if refrigerated.
The puddings can be warmed in a microwave oven at medium power.

The original recipe has half as much cinnamon and eggs.
I added the extra egg to make the pudding slightly custardy.
.PP
If you can get them,
Guittard's \fIVanilla Milk Chips\fP do quite well in this recipe in place of
the chocolate.
.PP
If you use a crusty bread,
trim crusts from bread before using.
I usually use Pepperidge Farm's white bread and I don't trim.
I think the average American white bread is not firm enough.
I have used a purchased whole wheat
\fIgranola\fP
bread with quite good results.
I think this recipe could easily be altered to include nuts,
chopped dates,
chopped dried apples,
and/or raisins.
.PP
For a richer pudding,
try using leftover cake instead of bread.
Once I even baked a small cake from a mix 
and chopped that up for this recipe.
One layer makes a double batch.
(It was a Dutch chocolate cake,
how decadent!)
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation and 15 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
