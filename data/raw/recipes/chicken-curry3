.RZ "CURRY CHICKEN WITH GRAPES" "Chicken fruit salad curry"
One day I was invited to a beach picnic, and asked to bring a salad. A
friend and I got together in his kitchen and concocted a curried chicken
salad with grapes. It was delicious, but we forgot to write down the recipe.
After some more experimentation, I have come up with this recipe. I don't
know if it is the same as what we made that day at the beach, but it is
similar and delicious.

Make the sauce by mixing together all ingredients except the chicken and the
grapes. Season to taste (sample by dipping a grape into 
the sauce and then eating it).
