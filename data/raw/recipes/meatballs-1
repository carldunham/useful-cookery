.RZ "MEATBALLS IN TOMATO SAUCE" "Simple meatballs in herb and garlic tomato sauce"
I've been making this recipe since I was about 10 years old, and I
don't remember where we got it.  It's easy and very good, though.

.SK 1
Combine the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil while preparing
the meatballs.
.SK 2
Mix all meatball ingredients.  It is easiest to do this with your
hands.  Form into walnut-sized balls.
.SK 3
Drop the meatballs into BOILING sauce.  If the sauce is not boiling,
the meatballs will fall to pieces.  Simmer gently for about an
hour.  If you are making the sauce to eat right away, you will
probably want to skim the grease that cooks out of the sausage
periodically. If you are making this ahead, the grease will congeal when it
sits overnight in the refrigerator, and you can remove it easily then.
.SK 4
Check for salt.  Depending on the brands of sausage and tomatoes 
you use, you may not need any. If you need to add salt, be sparing.
.SK 5
Boil the pasta.  Pour the sauce and meatballs over it and serve
with grated parmesan, or combine and reheat in a casserole,
sprinkled with parmesan.
.NX
This is fine made a day ahead.  Chilling it gives you a chance to
remove the grease that cooks out of the sausage.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
