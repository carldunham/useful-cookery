.RZ "BANGIN' BART" "Indian eggplant, onion, and tomato casserole"
This is an Indian dish, called \fIBaigan Bartha\fR in Hindi.
We make it a lot, and call it ``Bangin' Bart.''
It is eggplant, onions, and tomatoes, but not in the usual way.
.PP
In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked to mush, with only a small
amount of tomato\(emjust enough to flavor it.
.IH "serves 6\-8"
.IG "2" "large eggplants,"
unpeeled, diced.
.IG "2" "large ripe tomatoes,"
diced.
.IG "2 Tbsp" "oil" "30 ml"
(or clarified butter)
.IG "2" "large onions,"
finely chopped.
.IG "2 tsp" "salt" "10 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "black pepper" "5 ml"

In a large frypan, saut\z\(aae the onion in the oil until it is translucent. 
.SK 2
Add the spices, and stir for 1 minute. 
.SK 3
Add the eggplant and tomato, stir well, and cover.
Reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are mushy (about \(12 hour).
.SK 4
Remove the lid, and continue cooking until most of the liquid evaporates
(about 15 minutes). The finished dish should be thick enough that you could
use it as a dip.
.NX
I don't make this with any spices but salt and pepper. The genuine Indian
version of the recipe adds various Indian spices; try 
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
of fresh ginger,
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml"
of turmeric,
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml" of cayenne, and 
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
of garam masala for a more authentic Indian flavor.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.

no need to measure.
