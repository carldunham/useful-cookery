This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than 
recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first.  It also comes out very
flat\(emmost of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as many
noodles in the same size pan.  I found that some of the things can be
increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.
.SH RATING
