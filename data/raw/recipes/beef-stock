.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BEEF-STOCK SP "25 Feb 86" 1986
.RZ "BEEF STOCK" "A basic brown soup stock"
This is a similar stock to the one Jeff Smith describes in
.I "The Frugal Gourmet."
I usually use bones with meat on them; he recommends meatless ones.
.IH  "About 16 cups" "About 4 liters"
.IG "5 lb" "soup bones" "3 kg"
.IG "1 bunch" "carrots"
.IG "1 bunch" "celery"
.IG "3" "yellow onions,"
unpeeled
.IG "20 cups" "water" "5 l"
.PH
.SK 1
Brown the bones in a heavy pan if there is meat on them. If there is no
meat, roast the bones in a
.TE 400 200
oven for two hours, being careful not to burn them.
.SK 2
Chop the carrots, celery, and onions. The onion skin will add to the color
of the stock.
.SK 3
Place all of the ingredients in a heavy stock pot
and simmer for 12 hours.
Add water as necessary to keep the other ingredients covered.
Alternately, bring to a simmer and place, covered, in a
.TE 225 100
oven overnight.
.SK 4
Strain the stock.
A layer of fat will form on top of the stock as it cools.
This is a sufficient seal to keep the stock fresh in the
refrigerator for a couple of weeks.
It freezes well, too.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 12\-14 hours cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
