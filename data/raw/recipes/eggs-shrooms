.RZ "EGGS AND MUSHROOMS" "Eggs poached in mushroom sauce"
I got this recipe off the side of a bottle of cooking wine (which I had
purchased for another recipe.) It turned out to be so good that I used
up the rest of the bottle in repeat performances.

butter. Stir in flour. Blend well. Add
wine, broth, mayonnaise, onion, parsley, salt and pepper. Cook,
stirring until sauce is smooth.
.SK 2
Pour sauce in shallow baking dish. Break eggs over sauce, taking care
not to break the yolk (it makes serving easier if the eggs are
distributed symmetrically in the dish.) Pour 
.AB "2 Tbsp" "30 g"
melted butter over eggs.
Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 
.TE 350 175
until eggs are cooked to your liking
(I like the yolks hard, so I bake for about 20 min.)
.NX
If you use ordinary white wine instead of cooking wine, add
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml"
of salt to it.
.PP
You can use any mild cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 10\-20 minutes baking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
