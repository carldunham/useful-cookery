.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE QUICHE-MEXICAN M "14 Mar 86" 1986
.RZ "MEXICAN QUICHE" "Shrimp quiche in a Mexican style"
I found this recipe in the New York Times magazine a while back, called
``Dave and Janis Murray's Mexican Quiche.''  It's not hard to make, and it's
quite good.
.IH "serves 3"
.IG "1" "quiche shell,"
9 or 10 inches in diameter
.IG "\(12 lb" "large shrimp," "225 g"
about 12\-14, peeled and deveined
.IG "\(12 cup" "chopped green chilies" "85 g"
(Ortegas, not jalapenos).
.IG "\(12 cup" "colby cheese,"  "60 g"
grated
.IG "\(12 cup" "Monterey Jack cheese," "70 g"
grated
.IG "5 oz" "light cream" "150 ml"
.IG "3" "eggs,"
beaten
.IG "1/3 cup" "chives," "15 g"
chopped
.AB "(fresh or dried)" "(or use 3 g of dried chives, about 80 ml)"
.IG "1/3 cup" "sour cream" "80 ml"
.IG "\(14 cup" "salsa," "60 ml"
green or red, but fairly hot (use taco sauce if nothing else is available)
.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to 
.TE 425  220 .
.SK 2
Bring about 1 quart of water to the boil in a saucepan.  Add the
shrimp and cook for 2 minutes or until they loose their raw look,
no more.  Drain the shrimp in a colander.
.SK 3
Reserve 6 nice-looking shrimp for later.  Chop the rest.
.SK 4
Spread the chopped shrimp over the bottom of the quiche shell.
Use half the chilies to make a layer over the shrimp, then a
layer of Jack cheese, another layer of chilies, and a layer of
Colby.  Spread things evenly.
.SK 5
Mix cream, eggs, chives, and a little salt (if you want) in a bowl;
beat to blend.  Pour this into the quiche shell; it shouldn't
overflow.
.SK 6
Place the quiche on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes at
.TE 425  220 .
Reduce the heat to 
.TE 300 150
and bake about 35 minutes longer, or until
the filling is set.
.SK 7
Remove quiche from oven; let it cool for 15 minutes.
.SK 8
Spoon 
.AB "6 Tbsp" "100 ml"
of sour cream in round spots around the top of
the quiche.  Dip each of the reserved shrimp into the salsa and then
put them on the spots of sour cream.  Spoon the left-over salsa on
top of the shrimp.
.SK 9
Cut into six wedges and serve.
.NX
This goes well with a salad and a white wine strong enough to stand up
to the salsa.  If you serve bread, you might be able to feed six people;
otherwise, count on feeding 3 or 4.
.PP
For the quiche shell, see a French cookbook, or buy a frozen shell in your
market.
The Monterey Jack cheese
might be hard to grate. If so, then just chop it into bits with a knife.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy (except perhaps if you make your own pastry); deveining the shrimp is
tedious but not difficult.
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, one hour to bake and cool.
.I Precision:
Measure the filling ingredients.
