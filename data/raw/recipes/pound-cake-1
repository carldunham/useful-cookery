.NX
If you try to make a pound cake with margarine or shortening you 
will end up with a tasteless mess.  Butter is the major taste in a pound
cake; even if it weren't, butter and margarine have different 
properties in baking, and this recipe is adjusted for butter.
.PP
Don't make this cake if you don't have an electric
mixer or \fIvery\fR strong wrists.
I figure I spend nearly half an hour beating
butter and such when I make this cake.  Also, this cake is easier to handle
if you have a tube pan that comes apart into two pieces.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
30\-40 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
