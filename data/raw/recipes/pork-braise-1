.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE PORK-BRAISE-1 M "21 May 86" 1986
.RZ "INDONESIAN BRAISED PORK" "Pork with lime and hot peppers"
This recipe was originally based on one I found in a paperback
cookbook.  Over the years I have adapted it into what you see here.
It is fairly hot, but always gets rave reviews from everyone,
even from people who normally don't like hot food.
.IH "Serves 6\-8"
.IG "4 lbs" "pork," "2 kg"
cut into small bite-size pieces
.IG "1" "onion,"
chopped
.IG "2 Tbsp" "crushed red peppers" "30 ml"
.IG "4" "garlic cloves,"
minced
.IG "1 Tbsp" "lime juice" "15 ml"
.IG "2/3 cup" "soy sauce" "175 ml"
.IG "3 Tbsp" "brown sugar" "40 g"
.PH
.SK 1
Fry pork, onion, red peppers, and garlic over high heat
in a heavy frying pan, stirring frequently for about 
20 minutes or until well browned.
.SK 2
Add lime juice, soy sauce, and brown sugar.
.SK 3
Reduce heat and simmer for about 15 to 20
minutes.
.SK 4
Put in a covered dish and keep warm in the oven
while you make the rice to serve it
over. This makes it easy to make the rice, and the pork
actually browns a little more during this time.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
