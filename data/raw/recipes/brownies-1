.IG "\(12 cup" "half-and-half" "12 cl"
(also called light cream)

.IG "3 oz" "unsweetened chocolate" "90 g"
(3 squares)
.PH
.SK 1
Pre-heat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 2
Melt
.AB "2 oz" "60 g"
of chocolate and the butter in a heavy saucepan, then let it cool.
Be careful not to let the chocolate burn.
.SK 3
Beat the eggs in a large bowl until they are blended.
Add
.AB "1 cup" "200 g"
of sugar and mix well.
.SK 4
Stir in chocolate-and-butter mixture. Mix until the chocolate is fully
incorporated, with no streakyness. Add the vanilla, flour, salt, and nuts.
Stir just until the flour is incorporated; overstirring will make a tough
brownie.
.SK 5
Spread the mixture in a greased
.AB "11\(mu7 inch" "30\(17 cm"
pan that is 
.AB "1\(12 inch" "4 cm"
deep. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
.SK 6
Cool in the pan on a rack. While it is cooling, follow these instructions to
make the first frosting:
.SK 7
Mix
.AB "1\(12 cups" "300 g"
sugar,
.AB "1/3 cup" "80 g"
butter, and
.AB "\(12 cup" "12 cl"
of half-and-half in a heavy, medium-size saucepan.
.SK 8
Bring to a boil, then cook over moderate heat
.I "without stirring"
until a small amount of the mixture forms a soft ball when dropped in ice
water, or it reaches
.TE 236 113
on a candy thermometer.
.SK 9
Remove from heat immediately and cool in a pan of ice-water
until the candy is lukewarm. DANGER: melted sugar cools very slowly.
You can burn yourself badly by testing it with your finger.
.SK 10
Add
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
vanilla extract to the candy.
Beat it until it is creamy and of a spreading consistency.
This is most easily done with an electric mixer,
although you can use a heavy wire whip.
.SK 11
Spread the frosting over the brownies.
.SK 12
Melt the remaining
.AB "3 oz" "90 g"
chocolate, and spread over the frosting just put on the brownies. Cover as
evenly as possible.
.SK 13
Cool for several hours in a refrigerator,
then bring to room temperature and cut into pieces to serve.
.NX
Be very careful when melting chocolate.  It burns easily.
A double boiler is probably the best way thing to use.
.PP
It is critical to cook the first frosting to just the right point. If cooked
too little, it will be too thin to beat to a creamy consistency. If cooked
too much, it will be too brittle. So keep a close eye on it; sugar tends to
cook slowly to the soft-ball stage, then it cooks quickly.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
difficult.
.I Time:
a few hours preparation, several hours chilling and then warming
.I Precision:
measure ingredients carefully.
