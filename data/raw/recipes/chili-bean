.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHILI-BEAN M "14 Mar 86" 1986
.RZ "CHILI BEAN SOUP" "A variation of chili con carne with beans"
I got this recipe from
.I
A Primer on Bean Cookery
by the
.I
California Dry Bean Council
and other organizations.
.IH "Makes 5 to 6 cups" "Makes 1.5 l"
.IG "1 lb" "pink, red, or pinto beans" "500 g"
.IG "6 to 8 cups" "boiling water" "4 l"
.IG "1 tsp" "garlic salt" "5 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "onion salt" "5 ml"
.IG "\(14 tsp" "thyme" "1 ml"
.IG "\(14 tsp" "marjoram" "1 ml"
.IG "10 1/2 oz" "beef or chicken broth" "300 ml"
.IG "16 oz" "stewed tomatoes" "500 g"
.IG "3 Tbsp" "chili powder" "50 ml"
(or 
.AB "7 to 10 oz" "200 to 300 ml"
green chili salsa)
.PH
.SK 1
Rinse and wash beans. Soak using either slow soak or quick soak.
For slow soak, submerge beans in
.AB "6 cups" "1.5 l"
of cold water salted to taste and soak 6\-8 hours or overnight,
unrefrigerated.
For quick soak, submerge beans in
.AB "6 to 8 cups" "1.5 to 2 l"
of hot water salted to taste.
Bring to a boil, boil 3 minutes, remove from heat, and soak 1 hour.
Whichever method you choose, make sure you use a pot large enough
to let the beans expand 2\(12 times, and drain and rinse the beans after
soaking.
.SK 2
Put the beans in a large pot.
Add boiling water, garlic, onion, salt, thyme, and marjoram.
Cover and simmer until the beans are tender
(2\(12 to 3 hours).
Don't let beans boil dry. Add hot water as needed.
.SK 3
Spoon out 3 cups of the cooked beans to use another day in another way.
Mash the rest of the beans with their liquid.
Add remaining ingredients, plus 
.AB "1 cup" "250 ml"
of hot water. Heat at least 10 minutes to blend flavors.
.NX
I'm not sure why the recipe
doesn't call for you to cook a smaller quantity of beans, rather than
spooning out the cooked beans.
The pamphlet says that you can make the excess beans into a salad by
covering them with French dressing and refrigerating.  I think they're
trying to sell more beans.
.PP
Chili powder is a spice from Texas and Mexico
consisting mainly of ground dried chili peppers.
.PP
Green chili salsa is a Mexican condiment made from hot green chilies,
onions, vinegar, salt, and other ingredients.
.PP
The slow soak method gives beans a better texture.
Since these beans will be mashed, it won't make much difference,
unless you're concerned about those 3 extra cups of cooked beans
you will make into a salad.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
Easy
.I Time:
3 to 3\(12 hours when done by the quick-soak method,
overnight if slow-soak.
.I Precision:
No need to measure.
