.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE PORK-IN-MILK M "6 Feb 87" 1987
.RZ "PORK LOIN BRAISED IN MILK" "Italian-style pork roast in milk"
I got this recipe from a friend, who got it from a cookbook in Italy. It is
very rich and flavorful. I have not seen this method of preparation in any
other recipe.
.IH "Serves 4\-6"
.IG "2\-5 lb" "pork loin roast" "1\-2 kg"
(You can also use a pork shoulder roast)
.IG "2 Tbsp" "butter" "25 g"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "olive oil" "30 ml"
.IG "" "salt"
.IG "" "black pepper"
freshly ground
.IG "" "milk"
enough to cover roast; see instructions below
.IG "2\-3 Tbsp" "warm water" "3\-4 cl"
.PH
.SK 1
Find a saucepan that fits the pork roast closely, but still allows you to
turn the roast in it.
.SK 2
Add the butter and oil to the pan. Heat at medium-high heat. Brown the roast
on all sides.
.SK 3
Add salt and pepper to taste. Add enough milk to cover \(34 of the meat.
.SK 4
Cover the saucepan, but leave the lid ajar. Turn the heat down to medium and
cook for 1\(12 to 2\(12 hours, until the sauce has reduced to thick,
nut-brown clusters. If the sauce has not reduced after 2\(12 hours, remove
the meat, keep it warm, and increase the heat to high until the sauce
thickens.
.SK 5
Remove the roast from the sauce, if you haven't already. Turn the heat down
and skim the fat from the sauce. Add the water, turn the heat to high, and
scrape the bottom of the saucepan (there will be a crust on the bottom that
you'll want to get loose).
.SK 6
Return the meat to the pan, warm it up, and serve it with the sauce.
.NX
The cleanup for this recipe takes a while, because the saucepan
gets a crust on the bottom.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes preparation, 2\-3 hours cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
