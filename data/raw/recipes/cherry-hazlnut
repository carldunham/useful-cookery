This has simply got to be the best dessert you'll ever try.  My wife

.PH
.SH	PASTRY
.SK 1
Sift flour and add all dry ingredients together, with the sugar in the
centre, on a pastry board.  
.SK 2 
Add the butter (softened), egg yolk,
and water.  Work the liquids into the sugar, until it is creamy.
.SK 3
Now work in the flour mixture, as you would for any sweet pastry.
.SK 4
Press the dough into a greased 
.AB "9 in" "22-cm"
flan tin.  Prick the base of the pastry all over.  
.SK 5
Refrigerate for 30 mins, then cook in a moderate oven
.TE "(375" "(190" ")"
for 15 to 20 mins (until golden brown)
.SH	FILLING
.SK 1
Put egg yolks, sugar and vanilla into a bowl and beat until thick and creamy.
.SK 2
Heat cream
.I carefully
until almost boiling.
.SK 3
Combine the two mixtures, beating until smooth, then add the result to the top
of a double boiler and simmer until it thickens (STIR CONSTANTLY).
.SK 4
Dissolve the gelatine in the water, and add to the cream mixture, stirring
well until it is well mixed.
.SK 5
Allow this mixture to cool
.I completely
before adding to the pastry case.  Refrigerate until it sets.
.SH	TOPPING
.SK 1
Drain the cherries and reserve 
.AB "1 cup" "250 ml"
of the syrup.  NB: we don't use
commercial canned cherries. I would suggest a ``light'' syrup.
.SK 2
Arrange the pitted cherries artistically over the top of the tart.
.SK 3
Put the reserved syrup, gelatine and rum (we usually use cherry brandy or 
kirsch) into a saucepan and heat (stirring) until gelatine dissolves.
.SK 4
Cool the liquid and pour over the cherries.  Refrigerate until set.
.NX
Don't be put off by the complexity of the recipe\(emit is well worth the
effort.
.PP
All the egg whites ``wasted'' can be used in something else, such as a
Pavlova.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate to hard.
.I Time:
several hours preparation, cooking, and cooling.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients carefully.
