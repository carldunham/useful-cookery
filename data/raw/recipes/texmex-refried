Heat oil in a medium skillet.
.SK 2
Add drained cooked pinto beans
to the skillet and mash up into a paste. (I use an old hand potato masher
but a perforated metal cooking spoon also works well).  
.SK 3
Saut\z\(aae the beans
over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning
and adding a little bean broth as necessary for proper consistency.  The 
finished beans should be like thick library paste in texture.

10 minutes, plus cooking time of \fIfrijoles en olla\fR.

no need to measure.
