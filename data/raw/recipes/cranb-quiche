.RZ "SWEET POTATO & CRANBERRY QUICHE" "Sweet potatoes, carrots and cranberries in cream cheese quiche"
This recipe has become a real holiday favorite in our family. It is
originally from \fI The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two\fR by Anna Thomas.  It
is sweeter than most quiches, but not as sweet as most pies, and can be eaten
either as a side dish, or as dessert.  We usually eat it with the turkey
because no one wants to wait until dessert time!
