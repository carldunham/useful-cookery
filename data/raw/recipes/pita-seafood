.RZ "SEAFOOD PITA" "Pita\-Seafood Salad Sandwiches"
This recipe is more of a formula than a recipe.  It is excellent
for a cool dinner in the summer (any time after February in Texas!)
.IH "Serves 2\-4"
.IG "\(12 lb" "scallops or shrimp" "200 g"
.IG "\(14 cup" "olive oil" "60 ml"
.IG "1" "medium onion"
.IG "1" "garlic cloves"
(or more or less to taste)
.IG "1\(12 cups" "vegetable" "500 g"
(such as eggplant or zucchini)
.IG "\(34 cup" "mushrooms" "50 g"
.IG "to taste" "salt, pepper and spices"
.IG "1\(12 cups" "cooked couscous" "350 ml"
.IG "" "pita bread"
.PH
.SK 1
Cut up the vegetables into small
.AB "(\(12 inch)" "(1-cm)"
cubes.  Slice the mushrooms.
.SK 2
If using shrimp, peel and devein the shrimp and cut into small cubes.
.SK 3
In a small amount of olive oil,
saut\z\(aae the onion and the optional garlic until the onion is
soft but not quite transparent.
.SK 4
Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet and add the vegetable and mushrooms.
Saute until the vegetables are almost soft.  Taste and add salt, pepper
and whatever spices strike your fancy (oregano, basil, and red pepper
are good).
.SK 5
Add the scallops or shrimp and cook until just done\(emabout a minute
or two.  Scallops will turn opaque and shrimp will turn pink.  Do NOT
overcook.
.SK 6
There should be an excess of oil and fluid.  If not, add more oil and briefly
heat.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl.  Add the couscous and mix thoroughly.
.SK 7
Chill several hours or overnight.
.SK 8
Stuff into the pita bread (maybe with some tomato) and serve.
.NX
You could substitute almost any vegetable and crab or a firm fish.
To use this for a picnic, don't stuff the pita bread until you are
about to serve it.  Err on the side of too much oil,
since the couscous absorbs the oil (and a recent study says that olive
oil may be good for you).
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
