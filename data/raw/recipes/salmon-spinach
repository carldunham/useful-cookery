.RZ "SALMON-SPINACH LOAF" "A baked salmon and spinach loaf"
This recipe is a pleasant compromise between a salmon loaf and a spinach
souffle. It can be made with stale spinach and canned salmon. It does not
have a strong flavor or texture of spinach, as do some cooked spinach dishes.
.IH "Serves 4"
.IG "1 lb" "salmon" "500 g"
(1 large can)
.IG "\(34 lb" "fresh spinach" "350 g"

(1 can)
.IG "1 cup" "cornflakes" "30 g"

You can substitute concentrated dried cream-of-mushroom soup for canned

salmon are fine.
