.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BERRY-COBBLER D "21 Mar 86" 1986
.RZ "BERRY COBBLER" "Berry cobbler"
This recipe was lifted from \fITV Guide\fR's series of recipes from television
stars.  It is similar to the recipe for
.I "Berry Pudding"
found in Edna Staebler's
.I "Food That Really Schmecks"
cookbook.  I will list a few variations on it at the end.
.IH "Serves 6"
.IG "\(12 cup" "sugar" "100 g"
(for sprinkling)
.IG "4 cups" "berries" "1 l"
(fresh or frozen)
.IG "1 cup" "sugar" "190 g"
(for the batter)
.IG "1 cup" "all-purpose flour" "100 g"
.IG "1\(12 tsp" "baking powder" "7.5 ml"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "salt" "2.5 ml"
.IG "\(12 cup" "milk" "120 ml"
.IG "\(14 cup" "butter" "60 g"
(softened)
.IG "" "nutmeg"
.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to 
.TE 375 190 .
.SK 2
Sprinkle 
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 g"
of sugar on the berries, and place them in the bottom of a 
.AB "2-quart" "2-liter"
baking dish.
.SK 3
Combine the remaining dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder and salt).
.SK 4
Add the milk and softened butter, and beat well.
.SK 5
Spoon the batter over the berries. Sprinkle some nutmeg on top.
.SK 6
Bake for about 45 minutes.
.NX
You can use pretty well any type of berry for the base.  A favourite
of mine is a combination of strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.
.PP
The base of this turns out to be a bit thin and liquidy.  If you strain
the juice from the fruit, add a couple of tablespoons of flour to the
juice, and then pour the juice over the fruit in the baking dish, the
base will be semi-firm.
.PP
You do not need to sprinkle the full 
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 g"
of sugar on the berries;
with sweeter berries, much less will often suffice.
.PP
If you would like a sweeter, candy-like batter, try adding more sugar
to the batter.  I wouldn't recommend putting more than 
.AB "1\(14 cups" "250 g"
of sugar into the batter, though\(emthe crust of the batter will be
very candy-like, but the centre of the batter will not properly bake if
you do.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
