Chop the garlic very finely.  Chop the onion.

Combine in a suitable pot the tomato products and seasonings.

In a bowl, combine the meatball ingredients except the sherry.
Break this mixture apart into small balls or bits according to
preference.

Heat a wok or skillet and saut\z\(aae the meat mixture until cooked to 'rare'.
Do not overcook or singe the meat.

Remove the grease from the meat mixture by straining in a colander, then
return to the hot wok or skillet and reheat. Add sherry and reduce.
Add this to the sauce in the pot.
.SK 6 
Simmer this mixture on the lowest possible heat for 6 or 7 hours.
Stir occasionally.
.NX 
I have found that Hunt's tomato products deliver the best flavor for this
sauce; they are somewhat sweeter and less acidic than other brands.
I always use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce.
.PP
This spaghetti sauce is the work of about 2 years expermimentation.  It has
won some of the local cooking contests here in Maine.
