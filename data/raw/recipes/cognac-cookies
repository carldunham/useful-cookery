.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE COGNAC-COOKIES D "17 Dec 85" 1986
.RZ "COGNAC COOKIES" "A rich chocolate no-bake cookie"
A terrific, very rich, no-bake cookie.
Adapted from a recipe in the \fISilver Palate Good Times Cookbook\fR.
.IH "makes 3\-4 dozen"
.IG "6 oz" "chocolate chips" "175 g"
(semi-sweet)
.IG "2 1/2 cups" "vanilla wafers" "400 g"
crushed fine (a box less some nibbles)
.IG "1 cup" "pecans" "250 g"
(Finely chopped).
.AB "Start with 8\-10 oz whole pecans." ""
.IG "1/2 cup" "sugar" "100 g"
(white granulated)
.IG "1/4 cup" "corn syrup" "60 ml"
.IG "1/3 cup" "cognac" "100 ml"
(Use the best you can afford\(emit makes a difference!)
.PH
.SK 1
Melt chocolate bits. If you
have never worked with melted chocolate before,
then use a double boiler with the burner set on low.
.SK 2
Crush vanilla wafers very fine (fineness is important).
.SK 3
Chop pecans (again fineness is everything)
.SK 4
Add sugar, corn syrup and cognac (I use 1 nip of cognac and 
1/2 nip of rum\(emworks fine and costs less)
.SK 5
Stir in pecans and wafer crumbs. Now you learn why you were supposed to
grind them very finely.
.SK 6
By now the mixture should be a smooth paste.  Remove from heat
and form into
.AB "1-inch" "2-cm"
balls.  Roll balls in extra granulated sugar.
.NX
Store these in an air-tight container; if you are a chocoholic,
have someone hide them from you.  They are best if you allow 
them to age and mellow.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
Moderate to hard (melted chocolate is tricky, and rolling the mixture into
balls takes practice).
.I Time:
30\-60 minutes or more, depending on how deftly you can roll the balls.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
