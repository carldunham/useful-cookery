.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE MEATLOAF-1 M "21 May 86" 1986
.RZ "STEVE'S MEAT LOAF" "A quick and flavorful meat loaf"
This is my own adaption of a recipe I got many years ago
from a Campbell's soup cookbook.  It usually gets rave reviews from
guests:
.IH "serves 4\-6"
.SH		LOAF
.IG "2 lbs" "hamburger" "1 kg"
.IG "1" "egg"
.IG "dash" "nutmeg" "0.5 ml"
.IG "\(14 tsp" "black pepper" "1 ml"
.IG "\(12 cup" "canned mushroom soup concentrate" "125 ml"
.IG "\(12 cup" "onion," "100 g"
chopped
.IG "\(12 cup" "bread crumbs" "50 g"
.IG "1/3 cup" "marinara sauce" "80 ml"
(or spaghetti sauce or pizza sauce)
.IG "2" "garlic cloves," 
minced
.IG "2 tsp" "seasoned salt" "10 ml"
(or use a mixture of salt, pepper, cayenne, and celery seed).
.SH		SAUCE
.IG "8 oz" "canned mushroom soup concentrate" "250 ml"
(use the rest of the can)
.IG "3 oz" "mushrooms," "100 g"
sliced
.IG "\(12 cup" "sour cream" "125 ml"
.IG "\(14 cup" "drippings" "60 ml"
(from baking the loaf)
.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 425 220 .
.SK 2
Mix all ingredients together well, shape into loaf and put into a
pan. If you use a roasting rack instead of a bread pan, the
loaf will be less greasy, and you can use some of the drippings to make
the sauce.
.SK 3
Bake 20 minutes uncovered at
.TE 425 220 .
Turn down the oven to
.TE 375 190
and continue baking, uncovered, for 55 more minutes.
.SK 4
Make the sauce: Fry the mushrooms in the drippings and then combine the
drippings and mushrooms with the mushroom soup and sour cream. Heat this
mixture in a sauce pan. When meatloaf is done, put on a plate, cover with
sauce, slice, and eat.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation, 1\(12 hours cooking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
