.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE MEAT-PIE-1 M "29 May 86" 1986
.RZ "LIHAPIIRAKKA" "Finnish meat pie"
This is an excellent-tasting stomachfiller.
My dear mother gave me this recipe when I moved away from home.
She probably thought that it would give me that feeling of home.
It does. I have tried it on my friends, and it is always a hit.
My mother is from Finland.

.SK 1
Make the dough:
melt the butter and add milk. Heat the mixture to
.TE 100 37 .
Crumble the yeast into a bowl. Add the butter-and-milk mixture
and whip it until the yeast as dissolved. Add sugar, salt and flour and
stir until it becomes a dough. Cover the bowl, and let rise in a warm place
for about 40 minutes.
.SK 2
While the dough rises, chop the onion into very small pieces, and put in a
large frying pan. Add the ground meat immediately and saut\z\(aae for 10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cooked rice and saut\z\(aae this
mixture another 5 minutes. Add the cream, season to taste with salt and
pepper, and turn off the heat. Let the frying pan stand on the stove,
covered, until the dough is ready. Preheat the oven to
.TE 450 225
.SK 3
Roll out the dough so it fits in a 
.AB "12\(mu16 inch" "30\(mu40 cm"
baking dish. Put
the dough into the dish so that the dough covers the whole dish (this is
the most difficult part; don't be discouraged if you have to roll out the
dough again).
.SK 4
Add the filling on top of the dough. Whip the egg and spread it
over the filling. Bake it on the bottom rack
in the oven for about 20 minutes.
.SK 5
When the pie has cooled off a bit; cut it into pieces that are
.AB "1\(14 inches by 6 inches" "3 by 15 centimeters"
(the traditional size of lihapiirakka in Finland).
Serve.
.NX
While eating lihapiirakka,
you can try the hard work of pronouncing its name.
"Liha" means meat and "piirakka" is just "piirakka".
The filling can of course be varied. Other traditional Finnish fillings
for other "piirakka"s are blueberries (with some potato flour on top) and
cottage cheese.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
.I Precision:
measure the crust ingredients carefully.
