.SK 1
Mix together all of the marinade ingredients.
.SK 2
Slice the beef across the grain into thin, diagonal pieces (about the size of
your smallest finger).  Marinate for about half an hour.
.SK 3
Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it boils.
Add enough oil to coat the wok and saut\z\(aae the ginger.  Stir-fry the
lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool down too
much).
.SK 4
Reduce the heat.  Return the vegtables to the wok.  Add the topping.  Stir
around until everything is mixed and heated evenly. Serve.
.NX
Also add any other vegtables that you feel like.  Sliced carrots or broccoli
are especially nice.
.PP
Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is
the main ``spicy'' ingredient and should be handled with care.
Vary this ingredient to taste.
