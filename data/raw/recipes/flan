.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE FLAN  D "10 Dec 86" 1987
.RZ "FLAN" "A rich Mexican custard"
This recipe comes from the \fIDelicias Culinarias\fR cookbook that I
brought from Mexico. 
.IH "Serves 4"
.IG "\(34 cup" "sugar" "150 g"
.IG "2" "eggs"
.IG "2" "egg yolks"
.IG "2 cups" "milk" "5 dl"
.IG "1 tsp" "vanilla extract" "5 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
In a small kettle, heat
.AB "3 Tbsp" "40 g"
of sugar with
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
of water until the mixture turns brown. Pour the mixture into 4
gelatin molds. Move the molds around so that
the mixture coats the interior. Set aside.
.SK 2
Mix the eggs, sugar, milk, and the vanilla extract.
.SK 3
Pour the mixture into the molds.
Put the molds over a deep pan with water (double boiler or \fIbain marie\fR
technique) for 1 hr in a 
.TE 350 175
oven. Keep the water in the pan at the same level by adding boiling
water.
.SK 4
Cool and put it in the refrigerator. Unmold the \fIflan\fR before serving.
.NX
You can substitute liquor for some of the milk to make the \fIflan\fR
richer. Personally, I use  
.AB "1 cup" "25 cl"
of milk and
.AB "1 cup" "25 cl"
rompope (Mexican eggnog).
.PP
Be careful when coating glass molds as they can break because of the
sudden change in temperatures. You have to do it fast as the mixture
hardens very quickly.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
2\(12 hours
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
