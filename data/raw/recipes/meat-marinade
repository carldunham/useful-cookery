.RZ "CHINESE MARINATED MEAT" "Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade"

After frequenting a local Chinese restraunt, I finally asked
for the recipe for the marinade for the meat that came on
skewers on the \fIpu pu\fR platter.  I was given a list of
ingredients with instructions like ``heavy on this, light on
this''.  I devised my own amounts from this list.  I served it
to my family and they enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending
it to mod.recipes.
.IH "about 1 cup" "about 250 ml"
.SH		MARINADE
.IG "\(14 cup" "dry sherry" "60 ml"
(cooking sherry will do)
.IG "2 Tbsp" "light soy sauce" "30 ml"
.IG "\(14 cup" "dark soy sauce" "60 ml"
.IG "2\(12 Tbsp" "sugar" "25 g"
.IG "\(14 cup" "hoisin sauce" "60 ml"
.IG "\(14 cup" "unsweetened pineapple juice" "60 ml"
(or use the juice from the can of pineapple chunks listed below) 
.IG "1 tsp" "curry powder" "5 ml"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "white pepper" "2.5 ml"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "ginger root," "20 g"
cut into thin
.AB "(1/8-inch)" "(3-mm)"
slices.
.SH		MEAT SKEWERS
.IG "1\(12 lb" "sirloin tip" "650 g"
.IG "12 oz" "pineapple chunks" "300 g"
.PH
.SK 1
Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.
.SK 2
Cut meat into bite-size chunks, and place on skewers with 2 or 3 chunks of
pineapple in between the meat pieces.
.SK 3
Marinate the skewers overnight, in a covered container, in the refrigerator.
.SK 4
To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of
the chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on skewers is
even better.
.NX
You may need to double the marinade recipe.
I use a tupperware container made especially
for marinating. Any container will do, but it's tough having
to turn over all those skewers. 
.PP
The hoisin sauce, ginger root, and light soy
sauce should be available in any good grocery store.
Comments, revisions, and/or additions will be appreciated.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
Approximate measurement OK.
