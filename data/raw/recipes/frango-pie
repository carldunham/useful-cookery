.RZ "FRANGO MINT PIE" "Decadent chocolate mint pie"
One of the things that is memorable about Marshall Field's 
department store in Chicago is their ``Frango chocolate mints.''
This pie captures the flavor perfectly. I got the recipe from Malcolm Slaney,
who ``found it in a cookbook when [he was] attending Kayak School in Oregon.''
.IH "Makes one pie"
.IG "1 cup" "butter"  "250 g"
.IG "2 cups" "confectioners sugar" "250 g"
(sifted)
.IG "4 oz" "unsweetened chocolate" "120 g"
.IG "4" "eggs"
.IG "\(34 tsp" "peppermint extract" "4 ml"
.IG "2 tsp" "vanilla extract" "10 ml"
.IG "10" "vanilla wafers," 
crushed
.PH
.SK 1
Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
.SK 2
In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate. Add to the butter-sugar
mixture and beat thoroughly.
.SK 3
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each egg, until well blended.
.SK 4
Fold in the peppermint and vanilla.
.SK 5
Line the pie tin with the vanilla wafer crumbs (buttering the pie tin makes
them stick to the side a little better). Pour in the filling.
.SK 6
Refrigerate for two hours.
.NX
This recipe fills a shallow
.AB "8 inch" "20-cm"
pie tin; add 50% to everything to fill a 
.AB "9 inch" "25-cm"
pie tin.
.PP
If you're not very good at pie crusts (I'm not), feel free to use a pre-formed
graham cracker crust. The chocolate and mint flavors predominate, no matter
what crust you use.
.PP
This is serious decadence! The first time I made this, I stopped several times
in disbelief of just what I was doing. Enjoy!
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate (melting chocolate is tricky).
.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
