.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE COCO-CHIPS D "7 Dec 86" 1987
.RZ "COCO-CHIPS" "A nicely fattening combination of coconut and chocolate chips"
This comes from Mom.  (She doesn't know where she got it; she memorized it
years ago and lost the original recipe.)  It's always been a favorite with
us kids, and last time I was home she gave me the recipe.  It's so simple
that even a complete clutz like myself was able to make it perfectly the
first time.
