.SK 1

.SK 2
Melt the butter, and mix the rest in with it.  Pour over apples
and mix around so the apples are coated.

Put in an unbaked pie shell
.SK 4
Combine brown sugar, flour, melted butter, and nuts.
Spread over top of the filling.
.SK 5
Bake at 
.TE 375 190
for 50 minutes, or until it is bubbling.
.NX
The pie can also be frozen and then baked, right from the freezer, at
.TE 360 180
for 90 minutes.  The pies will keep a very long
time in the freezer, and not be worse for wear.

PS: For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but
the convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday
when the mood grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a
big plastic bag.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
