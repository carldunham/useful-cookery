.RZ "STIR-FRIED EGGPLANT" "A simple Chinese-style recipe for fresh eggplant"
My favorite for eggplants out of the garden is to stir-fry them with garlic
and hot peppers in sesame oil, according to this simple recipe.
.IH "serves 4"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "sesame oil," "30 ml"
or a mixture of sesame oil and clear vegetable oil, to taste
.IG "6" "Szechuan peppers"
.IG "1" "large eggplant,"
cubed
.IG "2" "cloves garlic,"
crushed or minced
.PH
.SK 1
In a wok heat the oil,
then toss in the Szechuan peppers.
After about 30 seconds (long enough for the scent to be released) toss in
the cubed eggpant and the garlic.
.SK 2
Stir-fry over moderatly
high heat until the eggplant is tender (about 10 minutes.)
Remove the peppers before serving.
