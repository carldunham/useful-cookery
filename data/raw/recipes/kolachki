This recipe is from Mrs. Malinch, my little sister's high school Russian
teacher.  I usually make this recipe at Christmas or Easter. 
.PP
My favorite fillings are poppy seed and walnut.  A recipe for the walnut
filling is included.  The poppy seed filling can be found canned (Solo brand)
in either the gourmet or cake section of most grocery stores.
