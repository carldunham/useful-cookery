cornstarch. Stir well and set aside.

.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml"
oil, and

.NX
Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
the same time as the chicken.
.PP
Bamboo shoots are available in cans at Chinese grocery stores.
Fresh broccoli is preferable to frozen, and it should be stir-fried for
only a few minutes to keep it crunchy.
Endless variations of this basic recipe are possible.
Beef, pork, or other lean meats can be substituted for the chicken.
Tofu cubes or brown beans can be used to make this a vegetarian recipe.
Chopped almonds can be used instead of cashews.
Water chestnuts are a delightful addition.
Green or red bell peppers can be used instead of broccoli.
