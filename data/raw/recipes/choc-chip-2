Preheat oven to
.TE 375 190 .
.SK 2
Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until creamy. Spend some time and
make sure it is well mixed.
.SK 3
Add eggs and vanilla, and mix well.
.SK 4
Add flour and soda, again mixing well.
.SK 5
Add chocolate chips. If it doesn't look like enough, then add some more.
.SK 6
Make big, thick cookies, big enough so that you get only 2 dozen of them out
of this recipe. Put them on a lightly-greased baking sheet.
.SK 7
Put the cookies in the oven, close the door quickly, and turn the heat down 
to 
.TE 350 175 .
Bake for 10 minutes.
.NX
The use of real ingredients instead of imitation ingredients cannot be
overemphasized. Chocolate-flavored chips, margarine, vanilla flavoring, and
other such atrocities will completely destroy this recipe. I use Challenge
butter and Ghirardelli chocolate.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy if you have a machine that can cream sugar and butter, moderate
otherwise.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking, 10 minutes cooling.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
