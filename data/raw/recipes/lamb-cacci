.RZ "LAMB CACCIATORE" "An Easy Lamb Stew"
I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure where she got it.
It's not a typical cacciatore (\fIi.e.\fR smothered in tomato sauce);
instead, it's tart and tastes of herbs.
It smells great when it's cooking.
It's very easy to make.

In a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish brown the meat in hot olive oil.
Be careful not to burn the olive oil: it has a lower burning temperature
