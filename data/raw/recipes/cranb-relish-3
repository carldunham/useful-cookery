.RZ "MAMA STAMBERG'S CRANBERRY RELISH" "Frozen cranberry relish with horseradish"
Susan Stamberg, former co-host of National Public Radio's
.I "All Things Considered,"
used to broadcast this recipe every year around Thanksgiving. She claimed it
was her mother's, but it turned out that her mother got it from a Craig
Claiborne column many years before. Very few people are neutral about this
unusual, rather strong relish\(emthey either love it or hate it. I'm in the
former group.
