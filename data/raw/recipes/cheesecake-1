.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHEESECAKE-1 D "29 Jan 86" 1986
.RZ "CHEESECAKE I" "Legendary cheesecake"
This is from a dessert-chef friend of a regular-chef friend, and apparently
won some award. I've had cheesecakes that I think are more impressive
(including one I can make), but I think I'm something of a cheesecake
connoisseur.  If I want to blow people's socks off, this is the one I cook.
I think that every time I've served it to a new group, at least one person
has said ``That was the best cheesecake I've ever had.''

.SK 1
Preheat oven to 
.TE 350 175 .
Combine crust ingredients. Press crust on bottom and sides of buttered 
.AB "10-inch" "25 cm"
springform pan. Bake 5 minutes, and cool.
.SK 2
Beat cheese until soft. Add sugar and blend well. Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each. Mix in the lemon rind and the vanilla, and add to
the mixture. Pour into the pre-baked crust, and bake 35 minutes.
.SK 3
Combine topping ingredients, spread on top of cheesecake, and return to oven
immediately. Bake 10\-12 minutes and remove from oven.
.SK 4
Combine dry glaze ingredients; add liquid glaze ingredients. Cook over low
heat until thick. Add 
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 g"
of butter. Cool, and spread this glaze on the 
cake before the glaze thickens too much.

Some pointers: this is the traditional crust,
but I often use a more floury-baked-pie-crust-like one.
It's not too critical.
The magic to getting the texture perfect is in how you beat the cheese.
I use a kitchen aid, work slowly, scrape the bowl often, and ALWAYS USE ROOM
TEMPERATURE EVERYTHING.  Using cold cream cheese guarantees lumps.
Don't beat too hard before putting in the sugar, but make sure it's even
and fluffy before the eggs go in. Then again, don't overbeat. It takes
practice.
.PP
I've been known to make it with no sugar or vanilla in the topping, and I
think it's more interesting. but the contrast between the layers may
confuse those accustomed to restaurant cheesecakes.
.PP
The glaze is easy as glazes go, but treat it properly.  In particular,
stir constantly until it's thick, but don't stir hard or you'll break down
the starch.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
rather difficult (timing is critical.)
.I Time:
1 hour.
.I Precision:
measure carefully.
