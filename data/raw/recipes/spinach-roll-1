.RZ "MANA'S SPINACH RICOTTA ROLL" "An Italian vegetable casserole with spinach and cheese"
Mana's spinach ricotta roll is a dish my roommate makes.  She got
the recipe from her Italian mother.  I hope you like it as much
as I do.

Make the crepe batter: mix together egg whites, flour and water,

Ladle
.AB "2\(12 Tbsp" "40 ml"
crepe batter into heated pan. The crepe batter should lightly cover the bottom
of the pan in a thin layer.  Tilt pan to cover evenly.  When edges of 
crepe turn lacy and brown and crepe is cooked through,
remove crepe and stack on a plate. Continue until all the batter is used.  
.SK 5
When the crepes are cooked, assemble the rolls: spoon 
.AB "2 rounded Tbsp" "50 ml"
of ricotta cheese mixture and
.AB "1 Tbsp" "20 ml"
spinach mixture on each crepe.  Fold or roll each crepe to seal in mixture.
.SK 6
Make and cook the casserole: 
place rolled crepes in a greased rectangular casserole dish.  When
the pan is full, spoon marinara sauce over crepes.  Bake at
.TE 325 160
for 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.
.NX
If you don't have a crepe pan, you can use a small 
.AB "(6-inch)" "(15-cm)"
frying pan. You can make your own marinara sauce, or use a prepared marinara
or spaghetti sauce.
