.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE MEATMARINADE-2 M "20 May 86" 1986
.RZ "SIMPLE MARINADE" "A simple, and quite superb meat marinade."
This is a truly wonderful marinade.  Just take the steak out of the
freezer in the morning before you go to work and pop it in the
marinade.
.IH "1 serving" 
.IG "1 Tbsp" "soy sauce (dark)" "15 ml"
.IG "1 Tbsp" "brown sugar" "12 g"
.IG "1 tsp" "oil" "5 ml"
.IG "1" "garlic clove" 
.PH                   
.SK 1
Crush the garlic and mix all ingredients together.
.SK 2
Add meat (steak) and leave for 
.I "at least"
1 hour, the longer the better.
.NX 
The recipe calls for 1 clove of garlic, but we often use 2 or more.
Be careful with the soy sauce, if it is too salty the marinade is not
so good.  This basic mixture can be varied infinitely; particularly, you can
use more marinade than this for one piece of meat.
.PP
I like to use sesame oil, or mustard oil for a little ``bite'' instead of a
bland vegetable oil.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
1 minute.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
