.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHOC-CAKE-1 D "20 May 86" 1986
.RZ "CHOCOLATE FANTASY CAKE" "A no-bake chocolate cake"
This is a very simple, quick, no-bake cake
for those of us who hate getting near an oven, but
like delightful cheese cakes.
This recipe is originally from
the \fIYediot Achronot\fR (Latest News) newspaper supplement here in Israel.
It should be prepared a day or two before you intend to eat it,
so that the flavoring fills out. Definitely not for people on a diet.

is sour cream. If you do this, replace the pudding with

If you are not a chocolate lover, you may replace the
chocolate pudding with vanilla pudding
