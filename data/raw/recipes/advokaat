.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE ADVOKAAT L "3 Nov 87" 1988
.RZ "ADVOKAAT" "Egg-cognac: a potent sweet alcoholic beverage"
Advokaat is the Dutch word for "egg cognac".
It is highly recommended for A. I. (Alcohol Imbibing) meetings.
This recipe is my modification of a recipe I obtained in Poland. It
makes a potent, superb advokaat (or egg-cognac). The milk and eggs are
healthy, the sugar and alcohol are not.
.IH "Serves 4\-8"

.SK 1
Mix sugars.
.SK 2
Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes. Let it cool down.
(For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later be used with a mixer.)
.SK 3
Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of the sugars.
.SK 4
Using mixer add to milk. Then (still using mixer) add alcohol slowly.
(The result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.)
.SK 5
Bottle and let rest for two weeks to let the mixture thicken.
.NX
This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a
spoon: it is quite thick.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes preparation, 2 weeks aging.
.I Precision:
Measure the ingredients.
