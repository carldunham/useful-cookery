.RZ "CRANBERY-APPLE COOKIES" "Moist cookies with cranberries, apples, and cinnamon"
Many years ago one of my brothers complained to me that he didn't like
cookies much, that they were always too dry and pasty. I came up with this
recipe for him. He still doesn't like cookies, but the recipe has made its
way to various other people to become a favorite.
