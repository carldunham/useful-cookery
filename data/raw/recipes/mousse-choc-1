.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE MOUSSE-CHOC-1 D "19 May 86" 1986
.RZ "CHOCOLATE MOUSSE" "A rich but not cloying chocolate mousse"
This recipe is based on one that appeared several years ago in
\fIBon Appetit\fR.
After much experimentation, we have come up with this recipe,
which is less sweet than the original and downright scrumptious.
(I even like it, and I don't generally like chocolate anything.)

.PH
.SK 1 
Make the crust:
Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
Cut flour and butter together.  With a fork mix in egg yolk,
vanilla, and lemon peel.  Press onto the bottom and sides of a 
.AB "9 inch" "23 cm"
springform pan, and bake for 10\-12 minutes at 
.TE 350 175 ,
or until it just begins to turn slightly golden.
.SK 2
Melt all the chocolate in a double boiler.  
.SK 3
Whip the whipping cream with
.AB "2\-3 Tbsp" "20\-25 g"
of powdered sugar (the stiffer you whip it, the
stiffer the mousse will be).  
.SK 4
Beat the eggs whites with 
.AB "2\-3 Tbsp" "20\-25 g"
powdered sugar.
.SK 5
Remove the top pan of the double boiler (with the 
melted chocolate) from the bottom pan and let it cool a bit. 
(``Cool'' means it's only cool enough so that when you add
the eggs in the next step, they don't cook.
You still need to be able to stir it.)
.SK 6
Add the whole eggs to the chocolate, one at a time, and mix well.  
.SK 7
Then add the egg yolks one at a time and mix well.  
.SK 8
Mix some of the whipping cream (enough to lighten the chocolate)
into the chocolate.
.SK 9
Alternately fold in the whipping cream and the egg whites into
the chocolate.
.SK 10
Pour into the crust.  
.SK 11
Refrigerate 6 hours or overnight.
.NX
This is my cheesecake crust.  A graham cracker crust
works well too.  The original recipe used a crust made from
chocolate wafer cookies.
.PP
If you have no better use for the extra egg white in making the crust,
add it to the eggwhites used in the filling.
.PP
I don't recommend Ghirardelli chocolate, as it's too sweet.
.PP
.PP
The function of the powdered sugar
is to help the cream/whites stiffen.  The sweetness
of the mousse comes from the semisweet chocolate, not the
powdered sugar.
Note 6:  You can also use a 
.AB "12-inch" "30-cm"
springform. Instead of putting the crust up the entire sides, just go up
half way.
Or you can use two
.AB "8-inch" "20-cm"
springforms.
In this case either spread the crust very thin or increase
the crust by 50%.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate to hard.
.I Time:
About 45\-60 minutes for beginners, 30 minutes once you have it down.
Cooking time:  15 minutes for the crust.
.I Precision:
crust ingredients should be measured precisely.
