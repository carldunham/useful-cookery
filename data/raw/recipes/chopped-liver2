.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHOPPED-LIVER2 M "12 Sep 86" 1986
.RZ "CHOPPED-LIVER-2" "My mother's chopped liver"
This would be my mother's rebuttal to Alan Marcum's chopped
liver recipe.  She always insisted that true chopped liver
should be made with beef liver, never chicken liver.
.IH "serves 3\-4"
.IG "1 lb" "baby beef liver" "425 g"
.IG "1" "large onion,"
sliced
.IG "2\-3" "eggs,"
hardboiled
.IG "" "peanut oil"
.IG "" "salt & pepper"
.PH          
.SK 1       
Fry the liver and onion over a low heat in a covered pan until
the liver is done (no longer pink on the inside), about 20 minutes.
.SK 2
Grind the liver, onion, juice remaining from frying, and eggs in
a meat grinder.
.SK 3
Add salt and pepper to taste.
.NX            
The secret of my mother's recipe is to cover the liver while you
are frying it and to then include the remaining juice in the
chopped liver.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
30 minutes.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
