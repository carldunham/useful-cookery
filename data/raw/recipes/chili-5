.RZ "CAPITOL PUNISHMENT CHILI" "World champion Texas red chili"
This recipe comes from Bill Pfeiffer.

in the International Chili Society's 14th annual World Championship
Chili Cookoff with it.

Pfeiffer calls this recipe ``Capitol Punishment Chili'' because

.NX
I use Durkee's Louisiana Red Hot sauce.
Probably your favorite brand of beer is ok.
Pfeiffer's ICS-winning recipe uses Budweiser because they sponsored the 
contest. 
For hotter chili, add additional \fILouisiana Red Hot\fR sauce to taste.
.PP
This chili is a great dish if you have a LOT of time.  Note well the
amount of time called for in each simmering step.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
4\-5 hours.
