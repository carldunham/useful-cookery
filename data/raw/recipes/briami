.SK 1
Prepare the vegetables: Cut the eggplant, zucchini and potatoes in
bite sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant). Remove the
stems and seeds from the peppers and slice them into strips. Peel and slice
the onions. Dice the tomatoes.
.SK 2
Saut\o'e\(aa' the vegetables except the tomatoes
in the olive oil in small batches. Saut\o'e\(aa' each batch for 2 or 3 minutes,
then remove from the pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough
oil is left for the next batch. When you're done, most (if not all) of the
oil should be gone from the pan.
.SK 3
Place the saute\o'e\(aa'ed vegetables in a baking dish and toss them
briefly so that you won't get only one kind of vegetable in one place. 
.SK 4
Add the tomatoes into the pan and saut\o'e\(aa' for a couple of minutes.
Crush the garlic and add to the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and pepper
to taste and simmer for another minute.
.SK 5
Pour the tomato sauce on top of the vegetables and bake at
.TE 350 175
or until the vegetables are tender.
.SK 6
Serve with plenty of fresh bread and, if you like, some feta cheese on the
side.
