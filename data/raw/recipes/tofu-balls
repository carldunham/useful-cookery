.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE TOFU-BALLS MV "1 Feb 88" 1988
.RZ "TOFU BALLS" "Vegetable and tofu \"meatballs\""
This recipe comes from the \fINew Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant\fP
cookbook.  They said that these vegetarian balls are ``one of our
most popular standard lunch items''.  I was skeptical, so I gave it
a try and indeed, they are quite tasty.
