.RZ "MELON BALL SALAD" "Margaret's X-rated melon balls"
I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich Saturday with mustard instead
of mayonnaise.  Better than I would have feared.  But the big discovery

.SK 1
Cut melons of three different colors into melon balls and drain the

of chicken broth, sherry vinegar, lemon juice, crushed garlic, salt,
pepper, and minced fresh tarragon, chervil, and lemon basil.

Dress
the drained melon balls and let the dressing sink in for half an hour.

In truth, I have to report that
Margaret herself thought the garlic was too much; but I didn't.

This recipe is not wholly unrelated to fruit curry, another godsend
for the overplump.

easy.

15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes waiting.

no need to measure.
