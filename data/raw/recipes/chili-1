.RZ "SUPER-BOWL CHILI" "A hearty (and hot) Texas-style chili"
This is a chili traditional in our Super-Bowl Sunday festivities.
It has won several ``no holds barred'' (non ICS) chili
cookoffs where there are no specific rules.  It is the result
of countless changes and adjustments of a small group of chili
afficianados (aka chiliheads).  Note: 
there is a range of peppers specified, you may adjust the ``temperature'' of
the resultant chili, mild if you use the low end, or nuclear
if you use the high end (we do!).

add it now; if not, add
