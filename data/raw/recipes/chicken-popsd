.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHICKEN-POPSD M "21 Feb 86" 1986
.RZ "POPPYSEED CHICKEN" "Chicken casserole with poppy seeds"
This is an easy and good way to use some cooked chicken.
I got the recipe from my grandmother, who
``hates to cook'' but nevertheless seems to do a great job...
.IH "Serves 4"
.IG "2 cups" "cooked chicken" "500 g"
(white or dark meat)
.IG "13 oz" "sour cream" "2 dl"
.IG "13 oz" "canned cream of chicken soup" "2 dl"
(1 can of condensed soup)
.IG "1 cup" "Ritz cracker pieces" "250 g"
(about 1 ``tube'' of crackers)
.IG "2 oz" "butter" "50 g"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "poppy seeds" "30 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, and put it on the bottom of a
casserole dish big enough to hold it.
.SK 2
Combine sour cream and condensed chicken soup in a pan, and pour
it over the chicken in an even layer.
.SK 3
In the same pan, (save dishes!) melt the butter, and add broken-up crackers
and poppy seeds.  Mix together and distribute over the chicken and sauce.
.SK 4
Bake at about
.TE 325 160
for 20-30 minutes\(emuntil the topping
is brown, the sauce is bubbling, and the chicken is hot.
.NX
Somehow this doesn't seem very nutritious.  Serve it
with lots of vegetables.  Broccoli and carrots go well.
Use more or less of the ingredients to taste, or
depending on how many you are serving. Use different soups.
Add mushrooms.  Add other stuff.  Have fun.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
40 minutes.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
