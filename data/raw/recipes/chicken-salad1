.RZ "CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD" "Chicken salad with Chinese seasonings"
This is a delicious salad my mother has been making for years. She found the
recipe in the cookbook that came with her wok. If you leave out the fried
bean threads, this is a reasonbly low-calorie dish. And if you use all
vegetable oils, there's almost no cholesterol in it (except for what's in
the chicken).
