.RZ "BOUILLABAISSE" "Marseille style fish soup"
A friend and I had been talking about the glories of bouillabaisse for the
past year and we finally decided to use New Year's Eve as an excuse to fish
rather than continuing to cut bait, \fIad nauseum\fR. The following recipes
are a combination of several derived from old \fIGourmet\fRs, Julia Child,
the Playboy Gourmet Cookbook, and ``gee, that sounds good\(emlet's add it.''
.PP

In a food processor fitted with the cutting blade, pur\z\(aaee all ingredients

With the motor running, add the olive oil through the feed tube in as thin a
continuous stream as possible. Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides.

.PP
Rouille is traditionally made with a mortar and pestle but I prefer to use a
food processor\(emit's just too much work otherwise. Pass the rouille as a
condiment.  Usually
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 ml"
per serving is sufficient\(emthis stuff is the
essence of garlic and hot pepper.  
.PP
If you can't get fish trimmings for the court bouillon, add bottled clam
juice and shrimp and lobster shells.
.PP
To be truly authentic, our bouillabaisse should have included eel, but
my friend was a bit squeamish about that so we left it out.  Basically,
any combination of shellfish and firm-fleshed fish can be used with the
more variety the better.  I dislike using crab since it flakes so easily
and is lost in the broth.  If you can't get live lobsters, substitute
frozen lobster tails but be careful not to overcook.
.PP
Use saffron threads, rather than saffron powder which tends to be adulterated
with safflower and not the same thing at all.  Be conservative with the
saffron\(ema little goes a long way and can give the dish a medicinal taste.
.PP
We preceded our dinner with herbed leek and proscuitto tartlets served with
champagne.  Dinner included bouillabaisse; a hearts-of-palm salad with
pimiento and greek olives and vinagrette dressing; lots of crusty french
bread to soak up the broth; a dry white wine (Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc '84);
and my friend's mother's sponge cake with whipped cream icing, fresh
raspberries and raspberry sauce, accompanied by Asti Spumante.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate to hard.
.I Time:
2 hours.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
