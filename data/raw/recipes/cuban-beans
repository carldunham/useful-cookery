.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CUBAN-BEANS MV "28 Jan 86" 1986
.RZ "CUBAN (PUERTO RICAN) BEANS" "Beans like they cook in many Caribbean countries"
This recipe is from my mother, who undoubtedly got it from one of my
father's relatives.  I've seen it described as being from various countries,
but it will always be Puerto Rican beans to me.
.PP
Any dried beans can be used, but kidney beans and navy beans are the best.
Chick peas aren't bad either.
You can use a ham bone for flavoring instead of the olive oil if you
don't mind using ham.
