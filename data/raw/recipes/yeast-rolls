.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE YEAST-ROLLS B "26 Mar 87" 1987
.RZ "EASY REFRIGERATOR ROLLS" "An utterly reliable recipe for yeast rolls."
I believe this recipe started its life on the back of a Fleischman's
Yeast package, but it has been memorized and modified for about ten
years now.  It is the most reliable yeast recipe I've ever seen: it's
never failed on me, and it always does an amazing amount of rising (my
family calls them mushroom rolls).
.IH "Makes 24 rolls"
.IG "6\(14 cups" "all-purpose flour" "1.2 kg"
.IG "\(12 cup" "sugar" "50 g"
.IG "2 tsp" "salt" "10 ml"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "dry yeast" "15 g"
(each package is about 1 Tbsp)
.IG "\(12 cup" "milk" "120 ml"
.IG "1\(12 cups" "water" "350 ml"
.IG "\(14 cup" "butter" "60 g"
.IG "1" "egg"

.SK 1
Combine 2 cups of flour, sugar, salt, and undissolved yeast.
.SK 2
Heat milk, water, and butter until liquids are very warm
.TE (120\-130 (50\-55 ).
Add to dry ingredients.
.SK 3
Beat 2 minutes at medium speed (I've never used an electric mixer, by
the way.  Just stir until things are evenly combined and not terribly
lumpy.)
.SK 4
Add egg and
.AB "1 cup" "200 g"
flour.  Beat at high speed 2 minutes.
Add enough additional flour to make a soft
dough.  This is where the arm muscles get their exercise!
.SK 5
Grease top of dough (with butter or vegetable shortening).  Cover the
bowl and refrigerate it overnight.
.SK 6
Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces.  Shape them into balls, and
place each in a greased muffin cup.
.SK 7
Cover; let rise in a warm place
.TE (75-100 (25-35 )
until doubled.  This will take between 1 and 1 \(12 hours.
Towards the end of the rising period, preheat the oven to
.TE 400 200 .
.SK 8
Bake at
.TE 400 200 
for 12 to 15 minutes.  Store the rolls tightly
covered\(emthat is, if there are any left.
.NX
This is the first really good yeast bread recipe I discovered when I
started making bread in the sixth grade.  Done carefully, it can
approach a delicate, cakelike texture.  It doesn't have to be shaped
into rolls, of course -- try it in a regular bread pan, or in fancy
shapes.
.PP
I use Fleischman's dry yeast.  I suppose cake yeast can be used, but it
always seemed like a nuisance to me.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
1 hour of work spread over 2 days.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
