This makes a very flavorful topping for broiled chicken or fish.

The recipe is from chef Cincy Pawlcyn at Mustards Grill, Yountville, CA.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine minced scallions, reserved lemon
juice and remaining ingredients.  Mix together well.  Serve over
grilled, broiled or roasted chicken or fish.

The original recipe calls for double this amount of olive oil, but that
seemed excessive.
