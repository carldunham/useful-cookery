Cook the noodles the full time shown on the package for serving.  Our

Beat all the remaining ingredients and add to the cooked noodles.

I usually add more vanilla, but this is the original recipe I took
from my mother.  If you like a soupier noodle pudding, increase the sour
cream and cream cheese.
