This is good everyday bread.
Be careful: it's easy to eat too much and get fat.
You may want to have someone who has made bread before help the first time
as the amount of flour may have to be adjusted depending on the slight
differences in your mesurement of the liquids and the humidity of the day.
Once you have done it it is easy to do by the feel of the dough.
