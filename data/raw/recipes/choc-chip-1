.RZ "CHEWY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES" "Chocolate chip cookies like Mrs. Fields makes"
These cookies are a combination of oatmeal and chocolate chip.  They are
very rich, but very tasty.  The recipe was obtained from a friend of
a friend, who supposedly paid a large amount of money for it.
However, the cookies do not taste \fBexactly\fR the same as the name brand.
.IH "Yield approximately 60"
.IG "2 cups" "butter" "450 g"

.IG "4" "eggs"
(large\(emuse 5 if medium)
.IG "2 tsp" "vanilla extract" "10 ml"
.IG "4 cups" "flour" "400 g"
(sift before measuring)
.IG "5 cups" "rolled oats" "250 g"
(oatmeal), powdered finely.
.IG "1 tsp" "salt" "5 ml"
.IG "2 tsp" "baking soda" "10 ml"
.IG "2 tsp" "baking powder" "10 ml"
.IG "24 oz" "chocolate chips" "700 g"

finely grated.

.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 375 190 .
.SK 2
Cream together the butter and the sugars.
.SK 3
Sift together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and shredded
chocolate bar. 
.SK 4
Add eggs and vanilla to creamed sugar and butter, then mix all ingredients
together.
.SK 5
Mix chocolate chips and nuts into mixture.
.SK 6
Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheet in small drops.
.SK 7
Bake 6 minutes or until done.
.NX
A blender works very well to powder the oats and the chocolate bar.
The blender chops the oatmeal finer than a food processor.
The powdered chocolate bar should melt at the touch of your fingers.
.PP
I prefer my cookies just barely done, so that they remain chewy.
If you want to send your taste buds into heaven, butter the cookies
as they come out of the oven (still hot), and eat them still warm
with a glass of \fBcold\fR milk.
.PP
Note that cocoa is not the same
thing as a shredded chocolate bar. Note also that oatmeal is not the same
thing as quick-cooking oats or instant oatmeal. Oatmeal means ``rolled
oats,'' such as Quaker oats.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
30 minutes.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
