.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHICKEN-GUMBO M "24 Feb 86" 1986
.RZ "CHICKEN-SAUSAGE GUMBO" "Gumbo with chicken and Andouille sausage"
This is a recipe that I got originally from Paul Prudhomme's cookbook,
\fIThe Louisiana Kitchen\fR. It is a classic Louisiana dish.
Serve with gumbo-style rice.
.IH "serves 5"
.IG "1" "chicken,"
cut into 10 pieces.
.IG "" "salt"
.IG "" "garlic powder"
.IG "" "cayenne pepper"
.IG "1 cup" "onions," "150 g"
finely chopped.
.IG "1 cup" "green bell pepper," "150 g"
finely chopped.
.IG "\(34 cup" "celery," "200 g"
finely chopped.
.IG "1\(14 cups" "flour" "25 g"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "salt" "2.5 ml"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "garlic powder" "2.5 ml"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "cayenne pepper" "2.5 ml"
.IG "" "vegetable oil"
for deep frying
.IG "7 cups" "chicken stock," "1.75 l"
homemade or canned
.IG "\(12 lb" "Andouille smoked sausage," "250 g"
cut into
.AB "\(14-inch" "\(12-cm"
cubes. (See note about this ingredient)
.IG "1 tsp" "garlic" "5 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Cut extra fat from the chicken pieces. Sprinkle each generously on both sides 
with salt, garlic powder and cayenne, rubbing the
spices in after all three have been applied.  Let stand at room
temperature while you chop the vegetables and heat the oil.
.SK 2
Chop the onions, bell pepper and celery, combine in a bowl, and set aside.
.SK 3
In a large, heavy skillet, heat
.AB "1 to 1\(12 inches" "2 to 3 cm"
of oil until very hot
.TE 375 190
to
.TE 400 200
Leave about
.AB "\(12 inch" "1 cm"
of space below the top of the pan, so it won't overflow when you add the
chicken pieces later. Use a deep fry thermometer if you have one.
.SK 4
While the oil is heating, combine the flour,
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml"
salt,
.AB "\(12 ts" "2.5 ml"
 garlic powder and
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml"
cayenne in a paper bag.
When the oil is almost hot enough, add the chicken pieces one
or two at a time and shake until they are well coated.  Save
.AB "\(12 cup" "50 g"
of the leftover flour.
.SK 5
Put the stock in a large kettle or Dutch oven, and begin
heating it to a boil.
.SK 6
Fry the chicken until the crust is brown on both sides and the meat
is cooked.  This takes about 6 minutes a side for light meat, a bit
longer for dark.  Drain on paper towels.  You may have to fry the
chicken in two batches.
.SK 7
Pour the hot oil into a glass measuring cup, being very careful
to leave as many of the browned particles as possible in the pan.
Pour
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 ml"
of the oil back into the pan and discard the rest.
.SK 8
Place the pan over high heat.  Using a whisk, gradually stir
in the leftover flour.  Cook, whisking constantly,
until this \fIroux\fR is dark red-brown (about 4 minutes).
Be very careful not to scorch the mixture, or to splash any
onto your skin as you stir.  Remove from the heat, add the 
vegetable mixture all at once and stir until the vegetables
are all coated.  Return the pan to low heat, and cook, stirring
constantly, for about 5 minutes.
.SK 9
Check that the stock has reached a boil.
Add the vegetable mixture to the stock in spoonfuls,
stirring with the whisk after each addition.  Return to a boil
and stir in the andouille and the minced garlic.  Simmer
uncovered for about 45 minutes.
.SK 10
While the gumbo is cooking, remove the skin from the chicken
pieces, and cut off as much meat as you can.  Cut the meat
into small pieces (about
.AB "\(12 inch" "1 cm"
cubes).  When the gumbo
is cooked, add the chicken meat.
.SK 11
The original recipe did not call for this, but I take time
to spoon off the fat from the top of the gumbo.  This is mostly
oil, which does not solidify when you chill it.  You should
be able to take off at least
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 ml" .
.SK 12
To serve as a main course, mound
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 ml"
of cooked gumbo-style rice
in a soup bowl, and ladle about
.AB "1\(14 cups" "300 ml"
gumbo around the rice.  For an appetizer, use
.AB "1 Tbsp" "20 ml" of rice and about
.AB "\(34 cup" "150 ml"
of gumbo.
.NX
Note about Andouille (pronounced an-DOO-ee) sausage:  this is a
uniquely spiced, smoked sausage made mostly in Louisiana.
If you can
get some, then use it; it makes a substantial difference to the recipe to
use it.  If you can't, then try the Polish sausage \fIkielbasa \fR
as a substitute. Do \fInot\fR substitute the sausage called ``Louisiana
Sausage'' or ``Louisiana Hot Sausage.'' It's not the same thing.
.SH RATING
