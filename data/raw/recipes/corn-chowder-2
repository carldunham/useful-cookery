.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CORN-CHOWDER-2 SP "8 Apr 87" 1987
.RZ "CORN AND SAUSAGE CHOWDER" "A rich creamy chowder with corn and sausages"
This chowder is a variation on a family recipe from an old roommate of mine.
(She makes it without the sausage, and with more water). It goes very well
with most seafood.  I am especially fond of it served with crab cakes.
