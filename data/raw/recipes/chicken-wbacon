.RZ "CHICKEN WITH CHIPPED BEEF AND BACON" "Succulent and easy chicken"
This recipe makes the most succulent and juicy chicken I've had.
It is very easy to make.
The only drawback is that you have to start the night before you want to
serve it. It would be a good recipe for when you have company,
since you can do most of the work the previous day.

A note on ingredients for non-US cooks: ``chipped beef'' is cooked spiced
beef cut into very thin slices and packaged for sandwiches. A worthy
substitute is 
roast beef sliced very thin and seasoned lightly with salt and pepper. A ``can
of mushroom soup,'' such as Campbell's soup, is
.AB "1\(12 cups" "380 ml"
of double-strength cream soup concentrate.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes preparation, 1 day waiting, 3 hours cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
