.RZ "SOUTHERN STYLE PORK CHOPS" "Pork chops in mushroom peanut-butter sauce"
I originally found this recipe in the Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery.
It is very easy to prepare and makes a hearty main dish served over rice
or noodles.

.SK 1
In a frying pan big enough to hold all of the chops at once, 
brown pork chops on both sides in a little shortening or oil. Pour off fat,
leaving chops in frypan.
.SK 2
Place an onion slice on top of each chop.
.SK 3
Mix peanut butter, mushroom soup, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper.
Pour over chops.
.SK 4
Cover and simmer over medium to low heat for 45 minutes.  You may want to
move the chops around in the pan from time to time to keep them from sticking.
.NX
Smooth peanut butter is best. The chunky variety gives a strange
consistency to this dish.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes browning, 45 minutes simmering.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
