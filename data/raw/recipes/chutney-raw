This recipe filtered down to me through a grapevine of neighbours.
You will need a supply of jam-jars, jam-jar covers and a large
pan to keep the ingredients in.

.SK 1
Mince the dates, apples and onions and place in a large pan.

Add the sultanas and stir in the sugar.

.SK 5

.NX
I sometimes use currents in place of the stoneless dates, in which
case you don't need to mince them. If the mixture appears too
liquid after the 24 hour standing time, it is worth draining off some
of the vinegar before bottling.
.PP
The beauty of this recipe is that
you don't have a vast pot of strange things bubbling away on the stove
for hours. A big win!
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
25 minutes preparation, 24 hours standing time.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK, but don't go overboard with the vinegar.
