.SK 1
Brown the ground beef in a large skillet with the onions and garlic,
drain off the fat.
.SK 2
Add the remaining ingredients except cabbage to the meat
mixture, and simmer for 10 minutes.
.SK 3 
Put half of the cabbage into a 2-quart casserole dish, top with half of the
meat mixture, top with the remaining cabbage, and finally top the cabbage
with the remaining meat mixture. (The casserole dish will be rather full,
but that's OK, it will cook down).

for 45 minutes.

I believe that the original of this recipe was lifted from a magazine
5 or so years ago, and sent to me by my mom. I've embellished it
somewhat (it was a little plain before...)
