.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BUTTER-COOKIES D "31 Dec 86" 1987
.RZ "BUTTER COOKIES" "Simple butter cookies"
After reading the ingredients on a can of imported Danish butter cookies,
I thought: ``Hey! I can do this myself!'', so I developed the following
recipe. It doesn't resemble the original too much, but considering that
the cookies don't stay around for more than two days, and that even my
mother liked them, they \fImust\fR be good!
.IH "Makes 2\-3 dozen cookies)
.IG "\(12 cup" "unsalted butter," "120 g"
at room temperature
.IG "\(12 cup" "granulated sugar" "90 g"
.IG "1\(12 cup" "white flour" "150 g"
.IG "1" "large egg"
.IG "1 tsp" "vanilla extract" "5 ml"
.IG "1\(12 tsp" "baking powder" "7.5 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Beat the butter with the sugar.
.SK 2
Add the egg and vanilla and beat until you get a uniform mixture.
.SK 3
Mix the flour and baking powder and gradually blend them into the mixture.
When you're done, you should have a rather sticky dough.
.SK 4
Shape the dough into balls, about
.AB "1 inch" "2 cm"
in diameter. Roll them in sugar
and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving about an inch of space
between cookies, so that they don't stick together when they expand.
.SK 5
Bake in preheated oven at
.TE 350 175
for 20 minutes.
.SK 6
Remove from oven, let them cool for a while, and start eating right away.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
Easy.
.I Time:
20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
