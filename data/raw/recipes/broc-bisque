.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BROC-BISQUE SP "9 Apr 86" 1986
.RZ "BROCCOLI BISQUE" "A broccoli soup \- hot or cold"
This recipe is from my mom.  It's been a hit every time
she or I have served it.  It is rather spicy \- not for the
timid or faint-of-heart.

.IH "Serves 8"
.IG "1\(14 lbs" "fresh broccoli," "550 g"
trimmed and cut up. Using slightly more is fine.
.IG "4 cups" "chicken broth" "1 liter"
(2 cans of canned broth, or use fresh stock)
.IG "1" "medium onion"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "butter" "20 g"
.IG "1 tsp" "salt" "5 ml"
.IG "1\-2 tsp" "curry powder" "5\-10 ml"
.IG "1 dash" "pepper"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "lime juice" "30 ml"
.IG "8" "lemon slices,"
(optional)
.IG "\(12 cup" "sour cream" "125 ml"
.IG "1 Tbsp" "snipped chives," "1 g"
(optional)
.PH
.SK 1
Place the cut broccoli in a large saucepan along with
the broth, onion, butter, salt, curry powder, and pepper.
.SK 2
Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for
8 to 12 minutes or until broccoli is just tender.
.SK 3
Place 
.AB "1\(12 to 2 cups" "300 to 400 ml"
of the mixture at a time into a
blender container.  Cover and blend until smooth.
Pour into bowl or another large pan.  Repeat with remaining
mixture.
.I
Be careful.  The hot liquid may scald you.
.SK 4
Stir in the lime juice.
.SK 5
Now you can either cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours
to serve cold (great in warm weather),
or you can go right ahead and serve it hot (great in cold weather).
Once ladled out, you can garnish with a thin slice of lemon,
a small dollop or sour cream, and a sprinkling of chives.
.NX
You can refrigerate unused portions for serving later, but
it doesn't keep well for long.  I like to blend it pretty well,
so that the texture is quite smooth.  Some people like it
a little chunkier.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
45 minutes.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
