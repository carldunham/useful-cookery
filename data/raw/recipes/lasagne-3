.SK 1
Sauce:  Put tomatoes and tomato sauce in large pot over low heat.  Press garlic,
add.  Chop onions, olives, mushrooms, and broccoli, add.  Add spices to taste.
Simmer covered over low heat until the whole tomatoes have merged with the rest
of the sauce and you can no longer tell where one begins and the other ends.
.SK 2
Cheese:  Grate the cheeses and mix.  Add eggs, parsley, and spinach, mix well.
.SK 3
Building the lasagna:  In a lasagna pan, put in just enough sauce 
to cover the bottom of the pan.  Make a layer of noodles.  Using about
half of the available cheese mixture, make a layer of cheese.  Another layer
of noodles.  Cover the noodles with sauce, the important thing being to make
sure all noodles have at least some sauce on them.  Another layer of noodles.
Use the rest of the cheese mixture and make a layer of cheese.  Put down the 
last layer of noodles, then use the remaining amount of sauce, or as much as 
possible, and cover the noodles in sauce.
.SK 4
Bake at 
.TE 375 190
for 45 minutes.
.NX
The lasagna noodles are 
.I uncooked
when you build the lasagna.  Be stingy with the sauce, if you aren't, you'll
end up short at the end where you need it most.
.PP
If you do things as specified here, you will end up with a lasagna layered
as (s-n-c-n-s-n-c-n-s), (sauce, noodles, cheese, etc.)
but some prefer the heretic's way: (c-n-s-c-n-s-c-n-s)
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
2\-3 hours.
.I Precision:
Approximate measurement OK.
