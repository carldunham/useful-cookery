.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE BREAD B "23 May 86" 1986
.RZ "SETTIN' 'ROUND BREAD" "A 7-grain bread for toasting or eating plain"
This bread was first made from whatever was settin' 'round the kitchen when
I started baking.  It has a wonderful texture and flavor.
.IH "2 large loaves"
.IG "\(14 cup" "water" "60 ml"
at
.TE 105 40
.IG "1/3 cup" "turbinado sugar" "65 g"
(most any sugar will do, though)
.IG "2 pkts" "active dry yeast" "14 g"
.IG "\(14 cup" "butter" "60 g"
.IG "\(14 cup" "shortening" "60 g"
.IG "1\(12 cup" "water" "350 ml"
.IG "\(12 cup" "milk" "120 ml"
.IG "1" "large egg"

.SK 1
Melt the shortening and the butter.  Let them cool a bit, so as not to
kill the yeast when they are added to the dough.  If you want to scald the
milk, do so, and also let it cool (it is common practice to scald milk
before baking with it, though I never do.)
.SK 2
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the
.AB "\(14 cup" "60 ml"
of lukewarm water.
.SK 3
Mix the cinnamon, oats, corn meal, bran, cracked wheat, buckwheat,
soy flour, and rye flour.  Add the rest of the water, the milk, butter,
shortening, egg, and honey, and mix well.  Stir in the dissolved yeast
mixture.  Mix in the salt, and the whole wheat flour.
.SK 4
Stir in the white flour, about 
.AB "\(12 cup" "50 g"
 at a time, until the mixture is stiff
enough to knead.  You'll probably have about half of it left.
.SK 5
Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, onto a floured surface.  Knead the
dough, adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough workable.
Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about ten minutes.
It's okay if you end up using less than or more than the three
cups of white flour; just use whatever it takes.
.SK 6
Put the dough back into a bowl that's been very lightly greased.  Let it
rise, covered, in a still, warm place (around
.TE 85 30
is best, though room temperature will work) for 45 minutes, or until it has
doubled in bulk.
.SK 7
Punch the dough down, divide in half, shape into loaves, and place each
half into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased.  Let rise again,
for another 45 minutes, in a still, warm place, until the loaves have
about doubled in bulk.
.SK 8
Preheat the oven to
.TE 350 175
as the bread finishes rising.  Bake the bread for 35\-40 minutes, until it
sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove from the loaf pans, and rub the top of
the loaves with some butter to give them a nice, soft, chewy crust.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
about 3 hours (half of it rising time).
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
