.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE PANCAKE-MIX B "22 Feb 85" 1986
.RZ "BUTTERMILK PANCAKE MIX" "A make-it-yourself mix for buttermilk pancakes"
This recipe comes from the \fIMore Make-a-mix Cookery\fR cookbook
put out by HP Books.  The premise of this book and its predecessor,
\fIMake-a-mix Cookery\fR is that you can save time and money by
making your own mixes for every stage of dinner planning.  It seems
to work.

The pancakes made from this mix aren't as sweet as those made from
Aunt Jemima mix, but they are good. You can always add sugar, of course.
.PP
Although we haven't tried this (yet), you could probably vary the
recipe by using a different type of flour to make, for example,
your own buckwheat pancakes.

If you can't find buttermilk powder in your local grocery store, try
a bulk food store.
