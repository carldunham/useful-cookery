This is based on a recipe my sister got from her high school

main course.

My sister insists on using a chicken stock cube, but I prefer beef.
Chicken gives you a lighter colour, but I prefer the darker colour
given by the beef. (Of course, real stock is better, but takes
time to prepare)
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
