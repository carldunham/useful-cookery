.RZ "WINTER VEGETABLE BEEF SOUP" "A thick and hearty vegetable beef soup"
This soup is almost thick enough to be called a stew.  It is great
on a cold day or after skiing.
.IH "20 cups" "5 liters"
.IG "1 lb" "beef soup bones" "500 g"
(As meaty as possible.  Meaty neck or cross-cut shank bones are particularly
good.)
.IG "12 cups" "water" "3 l"
.IG "1" "onion"
(medium to large, quartered. Don't try to use instant onion
in this recipe)
.IG "2 lb" "peeled whole cooking tomatoes" "1 kg"
(2 large cans)
.IG "\(14 lb" "fresh green beans" "100 g"
.IG "2" "small carrots"

.SK 1
In a large heavy pot, bring
.AB "12 cups" "3 liters"
of water to boil.  
.SK 2
Add beef bones, cover and bring back to full boil.
.SK 3
Reduce heat to low simmer.  Skim occasionally during first 30 minutes
to remove scum.  Cook for 3\-4 hours until meat is tender and nearly falls
off of bones.
.SK 4
Remove bones from broth.  Remove all meat and marrow from bones and return
to the pot.
.SK 5
Add tomatoes (including juice) onion, and herbs.  Simmer for 20 minutes.
.SK 6
Remove tomatoes, break up into quarters or smaller, and return to the pot.
Continue to simmer during next step.
.SK 7
Clean green beans and break into pieces.  Clean carrots and slice into
thin slices.  Slice kernels from ear of corn.  Shell peas.
Add vegetables to pot. Simmer for 30 minutes.
.SK 8
Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
.NX
I prefer beef neck or shank bones over what markets call ``soup bones''
which are nearly devoid of meat.
Individual-serving size cans of green beans, corn and green peas may be 
substituted if fresh vegetables are not available.  These are the basic
vegetables I use, but I have also added mustard greens, chinese cabbage,
zucchini and yellow squash (add just 5 minutes before serving or they
become mush) turnips and any other fall/winter vegetables that look
good in the market.  Serve with cornbread, sourdough or another strong
flavored bread.  This soup improves with age.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
Several hours of intermittent attention.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
