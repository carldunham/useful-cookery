.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE STOLLEN B "4 Dec 86" 1986
.RZ "STOLLEN" "Traditional German Christmas bread"
Germans traditionally eat Stollen around Christmastime.
This recipe comes from someone I went to school with.
She, and her parents, who are from southern Germany, recommended
it as quite an authentic recipe.
It is indeed a very tasty and rich bread.

.PH
.SK 1
Dissolve the yeast in the water and proof it.
.SK 2
Add the sugar, eggs, egg yolk, butter and half of the flour.

Let rise about 1\(12 hours, until doubled.
.SK 5

Roll into one or two rectangles, butter it, and fold over the edges
to make a rolled loaf.
.SK 8
Place on a greased cookie sheet with the folded edges down.
Spread with a combination of 1 egg white and
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 ml"
water.
Let rise until doubled in size (45 to 60 minutes).
.SK 9
Bake 30\-35 minutes at
.TE 375 190 
until golden brown.
.NX            
My loaves of stollen come out somewhat wide and short. Some traditionalists
make them long and narrow.
You can also make them in normal bread pans instead of on
cookies sheets, in which case you should increase the baking time somewhat.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
hand-on time:  30 minutes;
rising times:  1 \(12 hours + overnight + 1 hour;
baking time:  30-35 minutes.

measure the ingredients, though you can experiment with the fruits and nuts.
