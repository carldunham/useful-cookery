.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE GRAHAM-CRACK B "11 Oct 87" 1987
.RZ "HONEY GRAHAM CRACKERS" "North American crackers with graham flour, honey, and cinnamon"
 I originally got this recipe
from a newspaper and played around a bit until I thought it tasted like
Sunshine Honey Grahams.  I've occassionally used ordinary whole wheat flour
when I didn't have any graham flour and it still worked alright. Graham
flour is coarser.
