.SH		CAKE MIXTURE

or white sugar chopped in the blender

(Use more if you like)

.SK 1
Sift the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.
Soften the butter and add with the milk and vanilla to dry ingredients.
.SK 2
Beat for 2 mins with a wooden spoon or until smooth.
Add eggs and beat another 2 mins.
.SK 3
Pour into
.AB "an 8 inch" "a 20 cm"
round cake tin (I find the collapsible type best).  Cook in a moderate
.TE "350\-375" "180"
oven for 1 hour.
.SK 4
Turn the cooled cake over, slice into two layers and fill with cream.
Melt chocolate with copha (do not burn) and pour over cake, dribbling
it down the side. Decorate with almonds, pecans or walnuts.
.NX
Self-raising flour is popular in Britain and Australia, and hard to find in
North America. Substitute
.AB "2 cups" "200 g"
of ordinary all-purpose flour with 
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml"
of salt and
.AB "3 tsp" "15 ml"
of baking powder mixed in.
The North American equivalent of caster sugar is ``granulated sugar''.
There is no equivalent of copha, but a mixture of butter and coconut is
better than nothing. Crisco has the right cooking properties to substitute
for copha, but the wrong flavor.
.PP
You can pour a little Grand Marnier into the cake before
spreading the cream in the middle, but it doesn't need it.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour to cool and 5 minutes
decorating. 5 minutes to eat.
.I Precision:
Measure the ingredients, though the cocoa and cream are not critical.
