.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE MUFFINS-1 B "27 Mar 87" 1987
.RZ "BLUEBERRY MUFFINS" "Award-winning blueberry muffins"
These muffins won a blue ribbon during the years that I was eligible for the
Dade County (Miami, Forida) Youth Fair.  I think this particular recipe came
originally from the \fIBetter Homes and Gardens Cookbook\fR,
but I could be wrong.
.IH "Makes 12 muffins"
.IG "1\(34 cups" "flour" "180 g"
.IG "6 Tbsp" "sugar" "70 g"
.IG "2\(12 tsp" "baking powder" "12 ml"
.IG "\(34 tsp" "salt" "4 ml"
.IG "1" "egg"
beaten
.IG "\(34 cup" "milk" "180 ml"
.IG "1/3 cup" "cooking oil" "80 ml"
.IG "\(34 cup" "blueberries" "120 g"
.IG "1 tsp" "lemon peel" "5 ml"
(optional)
.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 400 200 .
Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Make a well in
the center.
.SK 2
In a separate bowl, combine the egg, milk, and oil.
.SK 3
Add egg mixture, all at once, to the flour mixture.  Stir
.B just
until moistened.  Yes, the batter
.I should
be lumpy.  (If you try to stir all the lumps out, your muffins will be
very tough.)
.SK 4
.B Carefully
fold in blueberries and optional lemon peel.
.SK 5
Grease muffin cups, or line with paper bake cups; fill each 2/3 full.
.SK 6
Bake at
.TE 400 200
for 20\-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove from pans; serve warm with butter.
.NX
The less you stir once you've combined the two mixtures, the better your
muffins will be.  (To a point\(embut overmixing is much more common than
undermixing.)  Frozen blueberries work fine, if you can't get hold of
fresh berries.  I'm sure other kinds of fruit will work fine, too,
but I haven't tried them.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate (proper mixing technique required).
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 25 minutes baking.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
