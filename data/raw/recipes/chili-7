be served directly or decanted into a crock pot to simmer.
.SK 5
Serve with shredded cheddar cheese, tabasco sauce, diced onions,
hot chili oil, red pepper flakes, and hot dogs with rolls.
Your guests can microwave their own hot dogs and top them
with chili and cheese!!!
.NX
For true CHERNOBYL-Class 20 megaton SS-19 chili,
double the pepper, chili powder and MSG and
add 30 minutes to the cooking in step 3.
Serve with Pepski.
.PP
People who are worried about MSG, bacon grease or radiation
should not be eating chili in the first place.
.PP
Yes, it will make an incredible mess in your microwave oven.
.PP
The most likely things you will need to add at the testing
points are salt, sugar, and maybe garlic powder.
.PP
The chili will thicken up in the microwave so be sure to
add enough water to keep it soupy until the last phase.
