.IH "makes 1 pan gingerbread"
.IG "1 cup" "butter" "220 g"
.IG "1 cup" "white sugar" "190 g"
.IG "2 tsp" "baking soda" "10 ml"
(That's SODA, not POWDER)
.IG "1 cup" "water" "250 ml"
(boiling)
.IG "1 cup" "blackstrap molasses" "250 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "salt" "5 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "ginger" "5 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "cinnamon" "5 ml"
.IG "2 3/4 cups" "white flour" "275 g"
.IG "2" "eggs"
(large)
.IG "1/4 cup" "powdered sugar" "30 g"
.IG "1/4 cup" "diluted milk" "60 ml"
(half milk and half water)
.PH
.SK 1
Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175
.SK 2
Cream together the butter and sugar in a bowl big enough to hold the entire
recipe.
.SK 3
Dissolve the baking soda in
.AB "1 cup" "250 ml"
boiling water. Add that mixture, and the
molasses, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and flour to the butter-sugar cream.
Mix only until moistened and evenly distributed.
.SK 4
Lightly beat the eggs, then add them to the bowl and beat the complete
mixture well.
.SK 5
Grease a
.AB "9\(mu13" "22\(mu33"
shallow baking pan (or a 
.AB "10-inch" 25-cm"
round casserole dish). Pour the mixture into the dish. Bake for about 45
minutes, or until a poked toothpick comes out clean.
.SK 6
Mix the powdered sugar and the diluted milk together to form an icing, and
brush on to the gingerbread.
.NX
Serve warm!
You can make a refreshing variation on this
basic recipe
by replacing
.AB "1 cup" "100 g"
of the flour with whole-wheat flour, reducing the sugar to
.AB "\(12 cup" "100 g"
and increasing the molasses to
.AB "1\(14 cups" "300 ml"
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
20 minutes plus baking and cooling time.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
