.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CABBAGE-SALAD SL "8 May 86" 1986
.RZ "FRENCH CABBAGE SALAD" "Wilted cabbage salad with bacon"
This is a wonderful thing to do with cabbage. With no garlic, and
using cider vinegar, it becomes German cabbage salad. Adding sour cream to
that makes Danish cabbage salad.

.SK 1
Cut the bacon into tiny bits, fry it
in a big deep frying pan, and fish out all the bits after they are
crisp.
.SK 2
Cut up the onion and garlic and fry them in the bacon fat.
When they are brown, pour in the vinegar.
.SK 3
Bring it just up to a simmer, add all the cabbage and bacon, toss it as
you would a salad, and serve it.  The cabbage doesn't cook, but it
wilts a little under the hot vinegar.
.NX
Cut the vinegar with a little water if you don't like very sour things,
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
