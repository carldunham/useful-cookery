.SK 1
Cut the mozzarella into sticks a bit more than about 
.AB "\(14 in" "5 mm"
thick, and about
.AB "1\(12 in" "4 cm"
long.  Coat the sticks with flour, shaking off excess.
.SK 2
Combine the bread crumbs and seasonings in a flat dish.  Beat the
eggs and place in a separate bowl.  
.SK 3
Coat the sticks by dipping them in the egg and then in the bread
crumbs. The coating on the first stick should be fairly dry when
you finish the last stick.  Repeat with another dip in the egg and
then in the bread crumbs.
.SK 4
Deep-fry the coated sticks in oil for about 3 to 4 minutes until the
coating is cooked.  Fry in batches, keeping the finished ones warm in
the oven.
.SK 5
Serve with chilled marinara sauce or salsa.
.NX
Use your imagination when choosing spices. The spices listed here are just a
suggestion.
.PP
Be careful when
frying, as some sticks split open when they are done,
leaving lots of cheese in your frying oil.  You may need
more egg or bread crumbs, depending on how many sticks you have and
how thick you coat them.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate (frying skill required).
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
