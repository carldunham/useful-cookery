.RZ "HALF MOON BAY PUMPKIN BREAD" "A dessert bread made from pumpkins"
Every year in Half Moon Bay, California there is a Pumpkin Festival, at
which prizes are given for the largest pumpkin in the world. Never mind that 
for the last two years the winner has been in Nova Scotia: the citizens of
Half Moon Bay take pumpkins very seriously.
.PP
At Christmastime in Half Moon Bay, people give each other little tins of
this bread as presents. I also take it backpacking, because it's
pretty resistant to being squashed (and tastes fine even when it is).

.PH
.SK 1
Preheat the oven to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 2
Butter your containers well.
.SK 3
Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl.
.SK 4
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and
add the eggs, oil, pumpkin and water.  Beat thoroughly.
It's easier to get all the lumps out if you use an
electric mixer.
.SK 5
Stir in the walnuts with a wooden spoon.
.SK 6
Pour the batter into the containers, filling each only half to two-thirds
full.
.SK 7
Bake for 60\-90 minutes, depending on the sizes of your
containers.  If you're using a very small container, start
checking much sooner.  The bread is done when a toothpick in
the middle comes out clean.
.SK 8
Cool about ten minutes, then loosen the edges of the bread
with a knife, and turn out of the pans to cool the rest of
the way on a rack.
.NX
For baking containers, you can use a loaf pan,
metal cans, or whatever.  I usually use 1-pound coffee cans,
and it takes three of them. If you want tiny loaves, you
could probably use soup cans.
.PP
I think the nuts are important in this recipe.  Unless
you absolutely hate them, leave them in.
.PP
It's not necessary, but you can serve some good cream
cheese with it to spread on the slices if you like.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy to moderate.
.I Time:
15 minutes preparation, 90 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
measure the ingredients.
