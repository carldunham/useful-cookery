.SK 1
First make the 
tomato sauce:  peel and mince onions.  Saut\z\(aae onions in 
.AB "2 Tbsp" "30 ml"
oil and
.AB "2 Tbsp" "30 ml"
butter, over moderate heat, until they are soft and lightly colored
(about 8 minutes).  Add mushrooms and saut\z\(aae.  Stir in tomatoes, tomato
paste, wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar.
.SK 2
Reduce heat to low and simmer
uncovered, for 30\-45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Most of the
liquid should be evaporated, and the mixture quite thick.
Remove skillet from heat and let it cool completely.
.SK 3
Start seasoning the eggplants: peel eggplants and slice vertically, 
.AB "1/8 to \(14 inch" "2 mm to 5mm"
thick.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes. 
.SK 4
Now make the
Bechamel Sauce: Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just 
until tiny bubbles appear along the edges.  Remove and set aside.
.SK 5
Melt one cube butter in 
.AB "3-quart" "3-liter"
saucepan over very low heat until foamy, being careful not to brown.  Slowly
add the
.AB "6 Tbsp" "40 g"
flour, stirring constantly
until smooth (3\-4 minutes), and still being careful not to let it brown.  
Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk.  When the mixture is 
thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings.
Cool sauce slightly.
.SK 6
Back to the eggplant:  Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and 
pat dry.  Dredge the eggplant in 
.AB "1\(12 cups" "150 g"
flour, and saut\z\(aae each in olive oil until it is brown on both sides.
.SK 7
Put it all together: Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth and
creamy.  Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce.  Stir in beaten 
eggs until thoroughly incorporated.
.SK 8
Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the top of the
tomato mixture.
.SK 9
Lightly grease a
.AB "16\(mu10" "40\(mu25"
baking pan that is at least
.AB "3 inches" "7 cm"
deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs.  Place a layer of
eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture.  Sprinkle
with breadcrumbs and grated cheese.  Repeat as many times as you have
eggplant to last.
.SK 10
Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at
.TE 300 150
for one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top.  Remove
moussaka from oven and let it stand undisturbed 20\-30 minutes; the
delay allows the layers to fuse.
.NX
The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest
(professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.
.PP
This recipe is sized for a large cake pan. If you cut the recipe in half it
will fit into an ordinary lasagna-size baking dish.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
2 hours to prepare, 1 hour to bake, 20\-30 minutes to set and cool.
Some can be done ahead of time.
.I Precision:
Approximate measurement OK for eggplant, tomato mixture.
