.RZ "HONEY-ORANGE LAMB" "Grilled butterflied leg of lamb"
This recipe is the same as Anita Cochran's recipe for grilled butterflied
leg of lamb, except that it uses a different marinade. I got the 
marinade recipe from a local wine merchant.
.IH "Serves 4\-6"
.IG "\(14 cup" "soy sauce" "50 ml"
.IG "\(34 cup" "pinot noir" "150 ml"
(Burgundy)
.IG "\(14 cup" "orange juice" "50 ml"
(juice of 1 orange)
.IG "2 Tbsp" "lemon juice" "30 ml"
(juice of 1 lemon)
.IG "2 Tbsp" "honey" "30 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "dry mustard" "5 ml"
.IG "1 cup" "tomato puree" "250 g"
(puree of 1 tomato)
.IG "3" "cloves garlic"
(or more to taste)
.IG "\(14 tsp" "ground black pepper" "1 ml"
.IG "1" "half leg of lamb,"
butterflied
.SK 1
Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb
in a bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade
(a glass 
.AB "9\(mu13" "22\(mu33-cm"
pan works well).
.SK 2
Pour the marinade over the lamb. Cover and marinate in the
refrigerator for 12 hours, turning occassionally.
.SK 3
Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm
but not flaming.  Place lamb on grill 
.AB "3\-4 inches" "8\-10 cm"
from the coals.
Cook 20 minutes on each side.
.SK 4
After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness.
Contrary to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should
still be a little pink.  When done, slice thin and serve.
.NX
This marinade also works well with chicken.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
