.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE SOUP-AZTEC SP "25 Oct 87" 1988
.RZ "SOPA AZTECA" "Aztec soup: a simple cheese, tomato, and beef soup"
I got this recipe from my mother, who got it from a friend in Tucson, Arizona.
The recipe is extremely simple and extremely quick. I like to serve it with
Mexican chef's salad (SALAD-MEXICAN).
.IH "Serves 4\-6"
.IG "2 cups" "consomm\z\(aae" "500 ml"
.IG "2 cups" "cream of tomato soup" "500 ml"
(use the recipe of your choice, or open a can)
.IG "4 oz" "green chilies," "100 g"
diced (or use more or less, to taste)
.IG "\(14 lb" "corn tortilla chips," "100 g"
crumbled
.IG "\(12 lb" "Monterey Jack cheese," "200 g"
cut into 
.AB "half-inch" "1-cm"
(or smaller) cubes.
.PH
.SK 1
Mix soups and bring to a boil.
.SK 2
Fill each soup bowl about 1/3 full with crumbled tortilla chips.
Place a layer of cheese cubes on top of the chips. Put one or two spoonfuls
of diced, drained chilies on top of the cheese.
.SK 3
When ready to serve, ladle boiling soup on top of the mixture in the
soup bowls. Do not stir. Serve immediately.
.NX
The boiling soup melts the cheese, but it also begins to make the chips soggy
as soon as you pour it on. If you chop the cheese into finer cubes, it will
melt more quickly, but if you chop it too fine, or if you grate it, then the
cheese will form a layer on top of the soup instead of remaining as disctinct
chunks.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes preparation.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
