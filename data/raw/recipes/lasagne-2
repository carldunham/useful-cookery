.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE LASAGNE-2 MV "29 May 86" 1986
.RZ "VEGETARIAN LASAGNE" "A vegetable lasagne with spinach, mushrooms and corn"
This vegetarian dish can be served on its own or with a side salad.
My thanks to Erica and Milica who gave me this recipe and who tried
different vegetable combinations until the corn stopped falling out of the
sides. Experiment for yourself\(emsubstitute different vegetables
according to the season and your preference.

.SK 1
Gently fry the carrots and garlic in some butter, set aside.
.SK 2
Gently fry the onions and mushrooms in some butter, set aside.
.SK 3
Wash the spinach and cook gently in a saucepan without adding any
water. Stir frequently.
This really does work and it stops it from going slimy.
Add the corn to this and set aside.
.SK 4
Now make the white sauce.
Melt the butter in a saucepan, take it off the heat, add the cornflour.
Mix this well.
\fISlowly\fR add the milk, stirring all the time. It is important not to
stop stirring, even for a moment.
Return it to the heat and keep stirring until it thickens.
.SK 5
Now build your lasagne.
Take a large square ovenproof dish at least
.AB "2 inches" "5 cm"
deep (we use one about
.AB "8\(mu12 inches" "20\(mu30 cm"
for the quantities given) and assemble in layers starting with a layer of
lasagne, then a layer of sauce, then one of the previously-prepared
vegetable pairs.
Repeat the lasagne, sauce, vegetable pair combination twice more.
At this point you should, if all has gone well, run out of vegetables.
Finish off with lasagne and then sauce.
.SK 6
Top with the cheese and sprinkle on a little paprika if you want.
.SK 7
Bake for about 35 mins at 
.TE 350 180 .
.SK 8
The servings should stay whole as you serve them.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy, but remember to stir the sauce.
.I Time:
20 minutes preparation, 35 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
