Rosie's lime juice, a common brand,
has a substantial amount of added sugar. Try to find lime
juice wtithout added sugar, or leave all the sugar out of the recipe if you
can't find it. Naturally you will get the best results if you squeeze fresh
limes to get the lime juice.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
trivial.
.I Time:
10 to 15 minutes, most of it spent grating the potatoes.

No need to measure.
