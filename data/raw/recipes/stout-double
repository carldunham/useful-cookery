.RZ "DOUBLE STOUT" "Double stout beer"
I would not recommend making this as your first beer, but if you are
into brewing, and like a \fIstrong\fR
stout, then give this one a try.  Don't be in a hurry to drink it, though,
it really benefits from a long aging.  I got the original recipe from Peter
Lester in rec.food.drink, and formatted it for my local brewfriends. Then I
thought that the net at large might enjoy it, too, so here it is with some
additional notes from my experience at making it.
.IH "Makes about 2 cases"
.IG "3 U.S. gallons" "water" "12 liters"
.IG "2\(12 oz" "Bullion hops" "800 g"
.IG "10 lbs" "dark malt extract" "5 kg"
.IG "1 lb" "black patent malt" "500 g"
.IG "2 lbs" "crystal malt" "1 kg"
.IG "\(12 lb" "flaked barley" "250 g"
.IG "\(14 lb" "roasted barley" "100 g"
.IG "\(12" "licorice stick"
(see note below)
.IG "1 tsp" "ascorbic acid" "5 ml"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "citric acid" "2.5 ml"
.IG "1 tsp" "Irish moss" "5 ml"
.IG "1\(12 oz" "Golding hops" "50 g"
.IG "2 tsp" "yeast nutrient" "10 ml"
.IG "\(34 oz" "ale yeast" "21 g"
(three standard packages)
.PH
.SK 1
Combine water and Bullion hops.  Boil for 20 minutes.
.SK 2
Add dark malt extract.  Boil for 20 minutes.
.SK 3
Add black patent malt through Irish moss.  Boil for 5 minutes.
.SK 4
Remove from heat and add Golding hops.  Steep for 5 minutes.
.SK 5
Cool and add yeast nutrient and ale yeast.
.SK 6
When fermentation has "stopped", add priming sugar and bottle.
.NX
Lester's initial specific gravity was 1.086 and his
final specific gravity was 1.020 (alcohol about 8%).
His fermentation time was 11 days (a slow batch).
.PP
My batch fermented in about a week (house
temperature ranging between 60 and 68).  It was barely drinkable after
6 weeks, but delicious after 3 months.  As far as I can tell, it's
still getting better (a year later), so try not to drink it all up
right away.
.PP
Ingredient note: I didn't know what a "licorice stick" was, until I
asked the clerk at my brewstore.  The one he gave me was about 
.AB "1/3 inch" "1 cm"
in diameter and
.AB "3 inches" "8 cm"
long.  It was dark black, and not sweet to the taste at all.  It seems
to be a standard brewing ingredient.  Sorry I can't be more specific
about it.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
For experienced beer brewers only.
.I Time:
1 hour preparation, 2 weeks fermenting, 6 months aging.
.I Precision:
