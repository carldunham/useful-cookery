.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CARROT-PUDDING D "16 Dec 85" 1986
.RZ "STEAMED CARROT PUDDING" "An old Welsh steamed carrot pudding"
This is a good steamed pudding, despite the list of
ingredients that are ``good for you''.  The sauce (following the
recipe) is not a necessity for good taste, only for authenticity,
although I LIKE it with the sauce.
.PP
This is a very old recipe,
I gathered it from my grandmother, who would have been
101 (sniff) this year, who learned it from her Welsh mother, who
learned it from her ... (in Wales), \fIergo\fR it's at least
200+.  Given its similarity to some late Medieval puddings,
one might suspect that its origins are much earlier.
.PP
I determined the quantities listed here by measuring what my grandmother
tossed into the pot.

.SH		SAUCE INGREDIENTS

.IG "\(12 cups" "brown sugar" "100 g"
(I use a mixture of light and dark)
.IG "1 tsp" "vanilla" "5 ml"

.PH "(Pudding)"
.SK 1
Mix the dry ingredients and set them aside.
Grease completely three large
.AB "(25-oz)" "(800 ml)"
tin cans, such as the kind used for tomato pur\z\(aaee.  Do NOT use the
plastic-lined variety.  Alternatively, grease one large steaming mold,
with a hole in the center. Or improvise.
.SK 2
Add the potatoes. Mix well. Then, in turn, add the baking soda, the carrots,
the bread crumbs, and the Crisco, making sure that you mix well after adding
each ingredient. This matters, so do it! You may have to get some help from
King Kong to blend adequately after adding the shortening.
.SK 3
Add, in sequence, the brown sugar, the beaten egg, the lemon extract, and
the vanilla, mixing well after each addition.
.SK 4
Now, add the dry ingredients mixture, a bit at a time. The mixture will be
extremely thick, and very difficult to mix.
.SK 5
Add the walnuts and the raisins. Mix them in. Go ahead. You're strong enough.
.SK 6
Push the mixture into the tins, with each about \(34 full, or a little more.
Seal the tins with aluminum foil, and use a rubber band to hold the foil on. 
(the pudding should not be exposed directly to the steam).
.SK 7
Steam 1\(12 to 2 hours, (until the
pudding seems uniform.  You can't overcook it, so err on the long side,
please!) and cool if you're not going to serve it right now.  
.SK 8
Make the sauce by combining all of the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan
and heating until it bubbles and all ingredients are dissolved.
.SK 9
To serve, reheat by steaming for at least 45 minutes, or serve out
of the original pot.
.NX
This stuff keeps in the fridge nearly forever (at least a month) as long as
you don't let it dry out.
.PP
Some add rum to this sauce. Suit yourself. I like it both ways.
.PP
Decant or spoon out (depends on if you want to be fancy 
or not) and serve with sauce, also steaming.
.PP
Then, don't eat for two days to make up for the calories.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate (considerable physical work required).
.I Time:
1 hour preparation, 3 hours steaming.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
