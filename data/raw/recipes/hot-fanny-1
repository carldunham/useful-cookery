.RZ "FISH IN HOT FANNY SAUCE" "Fish in a hot garlic/pecan sauce"
The Cajun Cafe in Portland Oregon serves a sauce whose recipe they got under
license from K-Paul's in New Orleans. They devoutly refused to answer all of
my questions about the sauce or its ingredients, so I've tried to formulate
it on my own, at home. This stuff doesn't taste exactly like what the
restaurant serves, but it's delicious in its own right. Maybe it's best to
title the recipe ``fish with something not entirely unlike hot fanny sauce.''
.PP
This sauce is best served with a moderately strong fish: I would
reccommend sturgeon, swordfish, or tuna.

Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet, add onions, garlic, peppers,
paprika, and diced pecans. Cook over medium heat until onions are clear.

Smear uncooked side with sauce before turning.

If you are cooking more pieces of fish than will fit in the
skillet at once, make the sauce ahead, put it aside (keep warm)
and add it before cooking each piece of fish.

or linguine with shrimp meat and pesto.
