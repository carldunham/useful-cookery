.PH
.SK 1
Cut up the chicken into bite-sized chunks.
.SK 2
Combine ginger, egg white,
.AB "\(12 tsp" "2.5 ml"
salt,
.AB "2 tsp" "10 ml"
cornstarch, and
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
oil.  Add the chicken chunks and stir until the chicken is well coated.
.SK 3
Wash green pepper.  Discard seeds and stem.  Cut into strips
.AB "1\(mu\(14 inches" "3 cm\(mu5 mm" .
.SK 4
Peel carrots.  If they are thick, cut in half lengthwise.
Cut diagonally into pieces about
.AB "1 inch" "3 cm"
long. Cook the carrots in boiling water for 3\-5 minutes, depending how
crunchy you like your carrots.
.SK 5
Drain pineapple chunks, saving
.AB "\(12 cup" "12 cl"
of the juice.
.SK 6
Prepare the sweet and sour sauce by mixing sherry, soy sauce,
vinegar, sugar, reserved pineapple juice,
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 ml"
cornstarch, and
.AB "1 tsp" "5 ml"
salt.  Stir well and set aside.
.SK 7
Heat
.AB "3 Tbsp" "50 ml"
of oil very hot in a wok or deep cast iron pan. Peanut oil is best since it
has a high smoking point. Stir-fry the chicken by putting a small batch
(e.g., 5 pieces) of the cubed chicken in the wok and stirring continuously
until golden brown. Remove to a dish. Repeat until all the chicken has been
cooked, adding small amounts of oil as it gets used up.
.SK 8
Heat
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 ml"
oil in an empty wok. Stir fry the parboiled carrots and the green pepper for
30 seconds.
.SK 9
Add the chicken and the pineapple chunks to the vegetables in the wok.  
Stir 1 minute or until well mixed and reheated.
.SK 10
Add sweet and sour sauce to wok.  Stir until thickened.  
.NX
Serve with rice.  I serve this recipe to company all the time and am amazed
at how many people don't realize that you can cook Chinese food at home. It
is always a big hit. The recipe works equally well with lean pork, tofu
cubes, or soy beans instead of the chicken.
.PP
Don't forget to start cooking the rice so it will be done at the same time
as the chicken.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty: 
easy.
.I Time:
45 minutes.
.I Precision:
measure the sauce ingredients.
