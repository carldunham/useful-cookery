.RZ "SAMBAL DABO LILANG" "Indonesian relish with lime, chili, and basil"
This recipe comes from the Time/Life \fIPacific and Southeast Asian
Cooking\fR. I've been unable to find a recipe even remotely resembling it in
any other Indonesian cookbook. I like to cross-reference recipes and learn
where they came from, but only the Time/Life reporters seem to have found
this one. In any event, it's quite wonderful. Not for the faint of heart.
