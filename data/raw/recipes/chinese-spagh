.RZ "CHINESE SPAGHETTI" "The original Chinese spaghetti"
This recipe is an interesting variation from the usual restaraunt chinese
food.  When I learned this dish, I realized that this was the origin of the
Italian pasta dishes. It still serves as a reminder that there is a huge
variety of Northern Chinese dishes that use wheat-based starches instead of
rice.

To prepare the meat sauce:
.SK 1
Heat
.AB "3 Tbsp" "50 ml"
oil in wok, brown the ginger and green onion, then add meat
and brown together.
.SK 2
Mix together the bean (or hoisin) and soy sauces, add this
mixture to the meat, and stir fry briefly.  Then add
rice wine, sugar, MSG, and sesame oil.
.SK 3
Add the chicken broth and simmer for about 3 minutes, until the sauce
becomes thick and shiny.  Put mixture in a serving bowl and set aside.
.PH "(GARNISHES)"
.SK 1
Boil bean sprouts for 1 minute, drain, and put in serving bowl.
.SK 2
Warm peas and put in a serving bowl.
.SK 3
Cut cucumber into very fine strips, or grate.  Place in serving bowl.
.SK 4
Scramble eggs, fry into very thin pancakes, and cut into thin strips.
.PH "(TO SERVE)"
.SK 1
Cook noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes; drain.  If
you are preparing this dish ahead, rinse with cold water, drain, and
add
.AB "1 Tbsp" "15 ml"
sesame seed oil and mix well.
.SK 2
Serve about
.AG "1 cup" "100 g"
hot or cold noodles in a bowl, then add the garnishes and meat sauce
to taste.
.NX
This dish can be prepared a day ahead and served cold.  The selection
of vegetables in the garnish is pretty arbitrary.  All kinds of
vegetable combinations are good.  The only rule is that they should
all be cut into thin strips.
