.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CABBAGE+APPLES V "3 Feb 85" 1986
.RZ "RED CABBAGE WITH APPLES" "A fruity cabbage saut\z\(aae"
I just tried this recipe from a column in the local paper. It's good
winter food\(emvery satisfying on a cold nasty day. My only caveat
is to use a *large* skillet, or halve the recipe. I cooked a full
batch and had cabbage overflowing onto the stove.
.IH "serves 8"
.IG "3 lbs" "red cabbage" "1.5 kg"
.IG "4-6 Tbsp" "bacon fat or butter" "60-80 g"
.IG "1" "onion,"
finely chopped
.IG "1 cup" "dry red wine" "250 ml"
.IG "2" "tart apples"
cored & diced (not peeled)
.IG "2 Tbsp" "brown sugar" "30 ml/20 g"
.IG "1 Tbsp" "wine vinegar" "15 ml"
.IG "\(12 tsp" "caraway seeds" "2.5 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Discard the outer leaves of a firm, 
.AB "3-lb" "1.5-kg"
red cabbage and cut it in half. Shred finely and soak in salted water for 15
minutes. Drain well.
.SK 2
Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large heavy skillet
and add 1 finely chopped onion. Cook onion until transparent, about 5 
minutes, then add cabbage. Toss well with two wooden spoons, as you
would a salad. When cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly ground black
pepper to taste, and red wine.
.SK 3
Simmer for 5 minutes and then add 2 tart apples, cored and diced, but
not peeled. Sprinkle with brown sugar, and add wine vinegar and caraway
seeds.
.SK 4
Cover, with lid slightly
askew, and simmer over low heat for about 45 minutes.
Serves 8, and is good hot or cold.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:

.I Time:
30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
