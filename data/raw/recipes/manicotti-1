.SK 1
Make sauce:
Saut\z\(aae onions in large pot with olive oil over medium heat.
Add crushed garlic.  Cook until onions start to brown.
.SK 2
Add cans of tomatoes along with paste, breaking any large chunks.
.SK 3
Add in seasonings and red wine.  
Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20\-30 minutes.
.SK 4
Make filling: mix filling ingredients in bowl, reserving
.AB "\(12 cup" "60 g"
of the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on top.
.SK 5
Preheat oven to
.TE 350 175 .
.SK 6
Cook manicotti until they are \fIal dente\fP (follow the instructions on the
box).  Drain, and stuff each with filling mixture.
.SK 7
Cover baking pan with
.AB "\(12 inch" "1 cm"
of sauce, and arrange stuffed shells on top.  Cover with sauce
and reserved mozzarella.
.SK 8
Bake at
.TE 350 175
for about 20 minutes, until cheese is nicely browned and sauce is bubbling.
.NX
While I prefer to use true manicotti, regular pasta shells are easier to
stuff and it's okay to substitute.  You can also cut each manicotti down one
side and rewrap it around the stuffing.  This freezes well uncooked; cover
with plastic wrap and foil.  Let it defrost in a 
.TE 200 95
oven for an hour or overnight in the refrigerator.
The cheese mixture can be modified to suit your tastes.  Cottage cheese
can be substituted for the ricotta.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate.
.I Time:
1 hour preparation, 20 minutes baking.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
