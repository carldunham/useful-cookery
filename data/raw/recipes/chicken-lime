.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE CHICKEN-LIME M "13 Apr 87" 1987
.RZ "SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE ROUGE ET VERT" "Chicken breasts in tomato-lime sauce"
This recipe was originally posted to net.cooks in May of '82 by Martin Minow @ decvax.
The French name means ``boneless chicken breasts in red and green sauce.''
I like it a lot.
.IH "Serves 2"
.IG "1" "whole chicken breast"
.SH		MARINADE
.IG "" "juice of 1 lime"
.IG "\(12 cup" "white wine" "100 ml"
.IG "1" "garlic clove,"
finely chopped
.IG "1 tsp" "ginger" "5 g"
.IG "pinch" "tarragon"
.SH		SAUCE
.IG "" "juice of 1 lime"
.IG "3 oz" "white wine" "100 ml"
.IG "" "salted butter"
.IG "3 oz" "tomato paste" "100 ml"
.PH
.SK 1
Mix the marinade ingredients.
Bone the chicken breast, obtaining 2 supremes, and marinate for at least 30
minutes. Reserve bones.
.SK 2
Cook a boullion using the bones. You will need about 
.AB "3 oz" "100 ml" of bouillon.
.SK 3
Drain, flatten, and flour the supremes. Saut\z\(aae quickly in clarified
butter, about two minutes on each side. Remove and keep warm.
.SK 4
Raise the heat to high, add wine, lime juice, tomato paste, and bouillon.
Cook down until it looks like it's been cooked too much. 
Remove from heat and swirl in a goodly chunk of butter.
If you remove the sauce too soon, it will be too soupy.
The sauce should be cinnamon-coloured and shiny.
There will be very little sauce\(emyou may need a rubber scraper to get it out
of the pan.
.SK 5
Serve with rice or some other bland vegetable.
.NX
Experiment with the sauce, varying the ratio of ingredients.
I have just strained the chunky bits from the marinade and used that.
Wear a raincoat when making the sauce. It splatters.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
moderate (judgment required).
.I Time:
30 minutes marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
