.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE PHEASANT-2 M "18 Nov 87" 1988
.RZ "PHEASANT AMERIND" "Pheasant in the North American tradition"
This recipe is adapted from the exceptionally good, controlled-circulation
\fIRecipes Only\fR Magazine.
The original dish was created by Mary Richard for
use in her Teepee Restaurant, in Winnipeg.  I found some of the ingredients
hard to locate in a hurry and used what I had available with good results.
You can substitute rock Cornish hen, guinea fowl, or chicken for the pheasant
and hazelnuts, filberts or walnuts for the black walnuts.

of the butter until golden.
.SK 5
Place birds into small roasting pan or casserole with just enough water
to cover the bottom of the pan.
Sprinkle with thyme and rosemary.
.SK 6
Bake, lightly covered with foil, for 30\-40 minutes at
.TE 350 175 .
.PH "(GRAVY)"
.SK 1
While the birds are in the oven, strain the broth and boil rapidly down to

.SK 2
Brown the mushrooms using the same skillet in which you browned the pheasant.
Remove the mushrooms and keep them warm.
.SK 3
Melt the remaining 
.AB "2 Tbsp" "25 ml"
of butter in the skillet.
Add the flour, stirring up the browning from the pan.

Cook over moderately high heat until golden brown. Blend in the broth using a

When the pheasants are cooked, remove them from the oven and scrape the herbs
from the skin.  After placing the pheasant halves on a warm platter (or leaving
them in the casserole), pour the gravy over the pheasant.  Garnish with the
