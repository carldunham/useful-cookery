.RZ "GREAT GRAPE CHICKEN" "Chicken in wine with grapes and orange"
This recipe was originally posted by Wayne Thompson.
I thought it was great, and I submit it here with some variations.
This colors in this dish are a feast for the eyes.
The recipe comes originally from \fIElegant Meals with Inexpensive Meats\fR,
by Ortho Books.

.SK 1
Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and nutmeg. Brown lightly in heated
butter in a large frying pan.
.SK 2
Add marmalade, tarragon, green onion and wine.
Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
.SK 3
Add grapes, cover again and
continue cooking about 10 minutes longer, until chicken is cooked through
(test with a small sharp knife in thickest part).
.SK 4
Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken and grapes to a warm serving dish;
keep warm. Add cream to liquid in pan. Bring to boiling, stirring, and
cook until reduced and slightly thickened. Salt to taste. Pour sauce over
chicken.
.NX
(WT) I use a whole cut up chicken.
.br
(CSR) I like to cook the chicken in a black cast-iron pan and
serve after step 3. I skip the
cream sauce, because it smothers the beautiful black-green-red-orange-tan
colors.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
30 minutes.
.I Precision:
approximate measurement OK.
