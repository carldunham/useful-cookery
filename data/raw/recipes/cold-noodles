.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE COLD-NOODLES A "3 Feb 87" 1987
.RZ "COLD NOODLES IN SPICY PEANUT SAUCE" "Mildly spicy cold noodles"
I first had this at Brandy Ho's in Chinatown, San Francicso.  I forget where
I found the recipe.
.IH "Serves 4"
.IG "2 Tbsp" "fresh garlic," "20 g"
minced
.IG "3 Tbsp" "fresh coriander," "10 g"
minced
.IG "\(12 cup" "peanut butter" "90 g"
.IG "5 oz" "light soy sauce" "15 cl"
.IG "5 Tbsp" "sugar" "60 g"
.IG "\(12\-3 tsp" "rice wine" "3\-15 ml"
.IG "1\-2 Tbsp" "hot bean paste" "15\-30 ml"
.IG "1 Tbsp" "sesame oil" "15 ml"
.IG "1 lb" "lo mein noodles" "500 g"1
(other noodles will do, such as ramen noodles or even spagetti).
.PH
.SK 1
Cook the lo mein according to directions.  Let cool.
.SK 2
Mix the rest of the ingredients.  Peanut butter doesn't mix very well, so
for a few minutes you'll think you've made a mistake.  Don't worry, just
keep stirring until it's smooth.
.SK 3
Add the sauce to the noodles.
.NX
Hot bean sauce also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is
the main ``spicy'' ingredient and should be handled with care.
Vary this ingredient to taste.  This recipe is probably very good without
it.  It's also quite good served when the noodles are still hot.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
.I Precision:
no need to measure.
