.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE SOURDOUGH-CAKE B "28 Jan 87" 1987
.RZ "GERMAN FRIENDSHIP CAKE" "A 10-day Sourdough cake"
This is known as the friendship cake\(emit's a bit
like a chain letter in that you have to find a set of friends to pass on
the starter to. 
.PP
During preparation put the starter
into a very large bowl (it foams up), and cover with a lid or
withcling film.

.PH "(STARTER)"
.SK "Day 1"
Blend the "starter feed" together, and then \fIhand mix\fR in the starter.  
I find it easiest to mix the flour and sugar together dry, add the milk to
the starter, and then slowly add the flour and sugar to the liquid.
The starter should \fInever\fR be  beaten with a blender
or refrigerated.  Pour the mixture into a large bowl, cover with
cling-film or a damp towel, and leave to brew.
.SK "Day 2"
Thoroughly mix the sourdough, then leave to brew again.
.SK "Day 5"
As day 1
.SK "Day 6"
As day 2
.SK "Day 10"
Print off three copies of this recipe.
Here now is why this is called a friendship cake.  Take 3 cups of Sourdough
mixture, and give them away with copies of the recipe 
as starters to your friends.  
Then proceed with the baking.
.PH "(MAKING THE CAKE)"
.SK 1
Blend all ingredients thoroughly with remaining starter. 
.SK 2

.TE 350 175
(English gas mark 4)
.SK 3

.NX
If you don't get cake starter from a friend, you can probably buy it in a
baking supply store.
.PP
Vary the spices to taste. The cake is quite pleasant if you forget them.

10 days brewing starter, 30 minutes preparing cake, 2 hours baking and
