This file is for people who know how to cook but who don't know how to
program, and who find that they are unable to get the help of a programmer in
getting the alt.gourmand software installed.

The novice installation is set up as a series of steps; at the end of each
you will be told what to do next.

To begin, type this command:
	Novice.start
Make sure you put the capital N at the beginning of it. If it doesn't work,
try typing this command:
	chmod 755 Novice.*
and then try
	Novice.start
a second time. If it still doesn't work, then you gotta get help.
