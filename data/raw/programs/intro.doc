INTRODUCTION(M)          USENET Cookbook          INTRODUCTION(M)

     The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in
     the image of a global village.
                    -Marshall McLuhan, 1967

INTRODUCTION
     This is a community cookbook, from an invisible worldwide
     electronic community. Like all community cookbooks, it has
     the favorite recipes of the members of the community, suit-
     ably edited and organized. The USENET Cookbook is a collec-
     tion of the favorite recipes of USENET readers worldwide.

USENET
     USENET is the network by which Unix computer users talk to
     each other. It is a worldwide net, made from computer-to-
     computer telephone links, linking some 200,000 people at
     7,000 sites in 30 countries. Besides serving an obvious
     technical and scientific purpose, USENET is also a medium
     for linking worldwide social groups of people who share com-
     mon interests. As an experiment in interactive electronic
     publication, the members of USENET decided in 1985 to make a
     cookbook of favorites from their "global village". Brian
     Reid of DEC Western Research in Palo Alto, California,
     organized the venture and wrote much of the requisite
     software.

     The USENET Cookbook is an online database distributed with
     the intention that it be published as a book.  The USENET
     Cookbook is distributed with software that enables every
     user to make his own customized edition of it, leaving out
     the recipes that he has no interest in, and perhaps adding a
     few of his own that he hasn't yet submitted to the network.
     There will be many different versions and editions of it,
     all with the same title, and all copyrighted. Every user can
     choose whether to print the recipes in imperial units (cups
     and spoons) or in metric units.

DISTRIBUTION
     The USENET Cookbook is distributed in the newsgroup named
     alt.gourmand.  It is a "moderated" newsgroup, which means
     that everything published in it must be approved by the
     moderator (editor). Readers submit recipes electronically by
     mailing them to the editor. He edits for style, form, and
     content, and performs conversion to or from metric units if
     necessary. The finished recipes are published in weekly
     batches, which are sent from Palo Alto every Thursday.

PROCEDURE
     To participate, you will need to get lt.gourmand at your
     site. A package of software for using it is posted from time
     to time into lt.gourmand. Get that software and install it
     on your machine; it will enable you to save recipes easily
     and to print cookbooks from them.

     To submit a recipe to the USENET Cookbook, mail its text to
     the newsgroup moderator,
     FI{sun,pyramid,ihnp4,ucbvax,decvax,allegra}!decwrl!recipes
     (uucp) or recipes@decwrl.DEC.COM (internet). The news
     software at most sites will do this automatically if you try
     to post to alt.gourmand.

     It's important that you tell us where you got the recipe
     from. It's ok if you cribbed it from a book or magazine or
     newspaper, but if you copy the words that you found there,
     you have probably violated a copyright. Copyright law is
     complex, and only a lawyer can reliably advise you on
     whether or not you are violating it, but in general if you
     rewrite a recipe, in your own words, even if you don't
     change the formula, then you are not infringing the copy-
     right by submitting that recipe to the network. The copy-
     right is on the words that explain the recipe, and not the
     recipe itself.

COPYRIGHT
     The entire USENET Cookbook is copyright by the USENET Com-
     munity Trust, which is a California organization formed for
     the purpose of holding the copyright.  The purpose of this
     copyright is to prevent commercialization of the Cookbook.
