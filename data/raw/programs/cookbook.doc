     from kept recipes
     rcbook.n [ -m ] [ -M ]    nroffs a cookbook from kept
     recipes
     rctypeset [ -m ] [ -M ] [ -f ]      typesets one recipe from
     std input
     rcnroff [ -m ] [ -M ]     nroffs one recipe from std input
     rcnew.t [ -m ] [ -M ] [ -f ]   typesets new kept recipes
     rcnew.n [ -m ] [ -M ]     nroffs new kept recipes

DESCRIPTION
     The USENET Cookbook is an online database distributed in the
     alt.gourmand  newsgroup. This software makes it easy for you
     to clip recipes that interest you, to store them in your own
     directory,  and  to make printed cookbooks from those stored
     recipes.

SAVING RECIPES ONE AT A TIME
     Read the news with your favorite news  reading  program.  If
     you  don't  have  a  favorite, try rn. When you see a recipe
     that interests you, type
          s |rckeep
     The ``s'' command means ``save'';  the  vertical  bar  means
     ``save  into  a  program''. rckeep is the program that keeps
     recipes.  It  will  save  recipes  into  a  directory  named
     Recipes,  and  it  will  create that directory for you if it
     does not currently exist. If you would like recipes saved in
     some other place, you can type
          s |rckeep PartyRecipes
          s |rckeep ~/PartyRecipes
          s |rckeep /usr/local/lib/Recipes
     and so forth.

SAVING NEW RECIPES AUTOMATICALLY
     If you don't want to take the time and trouble to run rckeep
     on  every  recipe,  you can run rckeepnew from time to time.
     When rckeepnew is run, it  looks  in  the  netnews  spooling
     directory to find the files that hold the articles that hold
     the recipes, and automatically runs  rckeep  on  every  file
     that  contains  a recipe and that has arrived since the last
     time you ran rckeepnew. Like rckeep, rckeepnew can be  given
     the name of a directory to use as the keep directory:
        rckeepnew
     or

        rckeepnew /usr/local/lib/Recipes
     and so forth.

HOW RECIPES ARE STORED
     Every  recipe  is  given  a  code  word  by  the  editor  of
     alt.gourmand.  That  code word is contained in the first few
     lines of the article body. The rckeep and rckeepnew programs
     use  that  code  word as a file name in your keep directory.
     For example,  if  you  are  saving  a  recipe  whose  1-line
     description is
          PHEASANT-PERRY - Pheasant for Thanksgiving
     it will be saved in your keep directory under  the  filename
     ``pheasant-perry''.   These  filenames  are  forced to lower
     case by rckeep.

MAKING A COOKBOOK
     To typeset a cookbook, just type
          rcbook.t
     and all of the  recipes  in  your  keep  directory  will  be
     typeset  in alphabetical order, with an index, introduction,
     and title page added. They will come out either  in  English
     units  (cups  and  teaspoons)  or in metric units (grams and
     deciliters) depending on how the alt.gourmand  software  has
     been  installed at your site. If you want to print the cook-
     book in cups and spoons  regardless  of  what  the  software
     installer did, then type
        rcbook.t -M
     and if you want  to  print  the  cookbook  in  metric  units
     regardless of what the software installer did, then type
        rcbook.t -m
     If you don't have a typesetter or  if  you  don't  have  the
     troff(1)  program,  then  use  ``rcbook.n'' instead; it uses
     nroff(1). and sends the results of the formatting  to  stan-
     dard  output.  It  supports  the same -m and -M options that
     rcbook.t does.

     If you have more than  one  keep  directory,  for  specialty
     cookbooks  of  different types, you can give rcbook a direc-
     tory name as an argument, e.g.:
        rcbook.t /usr/local/lib/Recipes

     You can capture the output of rcbook.t in a  file  by  using
     the ``-t'' option:
        rcbook.t -t > FormattedFile

PRINTING ONE RECIPE
     The program rctypeset typesets one recipe, from its standard
     input.  It is able to discard news and mail headers from the
     beginning of the recipe; you may use rctypeset on a  netnews
     message  in  the form that it is stored in a spooling direc-
     tory, or you may use it directly from  a  news-reading  pro-
     gram. rctypeset supports the metric (-m) and non-metric (-M)

     options explained above.

     The program rcnroff performs the same function as rctypeset,
     except  that it formats to standard output instead of to the
     typesetter.

PRINTING NEW RECIPES
     It is a nuisance to keep track of  which  recipes  you  have
     printed  and which you have not. It is expensive and slow to
     print the entire cookbook every  time  a  few  more  recipes
     arrive.  The  rcnew.t program works very much like rcbook.t,
     except that it typesets only those  recipes  that  were  put
     into the keep directory after the last time you ran rcnew.t.
     It produces a complete new index, though. It uses the  crea-
     tion  time  of  the  file INDEX in your current directory to
     determine the last time  you  created  an  index,  which  is
     presumably  the  last  time  you  ran  rcbook.t  or rcnew.t.
     rcnew.t supports the metric (-m) and non-metric (-M) options
     explained above.

     The program rcnew.n does the same thing as  rcnew.t,  except
     that  it  formats  to  standard  output  instead  of  to the
     typesetter.

THE INDEX
     The cookbook index is a ``permuted index''. This means  that
     each  recipe  is  indexed  by every major word in its title.
     Some people seem to find this format jarring, and more  than
     one  person  has  filed  a bug report upon seeing the index,
     certain that the output that it produces cannot possibly  be
     correct.

     Since your notebook of recipes  will  grow  each  week,  the
     pages cannot have numbers. Instead, the pages are identified
     by the code name for each recipe, with the expectation  that
     you  will  keep  your notebook in alphabetical order by this
     name.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS
     Troff has a number of special characters, such  as  such  as
     typeset fractions (``1/2'' for 1/2), which are not available
     on some brands of typesetters and laser  printers.  If  your
     typesetter  handles  those  characters incorrectly, then you
     should add the ``-f'' option  to  rcbook.t,  rctypeset,  and
     rcnew.t.  The  ``-f''  option  causes the recipe software to
     translate those special characters into standard ASCII char-
     acters before printing.
