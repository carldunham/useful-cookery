.SK 1
Slice onions into thin rings.  Trim bacon and roughly chop.
In a large saucepan, melt a little butter and saute the onion.  
Add the bacon.  Remove from heat.
.SK 2
The tomatoes should be ripe, or beyond.  Green tomatoes will not do.
Wash and clean the tomatoes if necessary.  Remove the dregs of the stalks.
.SK 3
In a blender (or processor) blend the tomatoes, skin and all, until smooth.
Put this tomato pur\z\(aaee into the saucepan as you produce it.
Add pepper to taste.
.SK 4
Bring to boil and simmer gently for 20 minutes.  Near the end, add the
frozen peas (for a green contrast) and bring back to simmer.
.NX
Some people like
to strain the tomato to remove seeds and skin but I blend long enough,
and use everything.
.SH RATING
